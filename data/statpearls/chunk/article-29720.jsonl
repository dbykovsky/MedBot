[9] Surgical ablation is the most common choice as this procedure aims to conserve the more dominant thumb, ablate the smaller and more hypoplastic thumb, and reconstruct the collateral ligaments as necessary. [9] The objective is to establish a stable and functional thumb while minimizing the necessity for future repeat procedures. Simple suture ligation, involving tying a thread around the extra digit to cut off blood supply, is discouraged for managing preaxial polydactyly due to numerous potential complications, as discussed below.

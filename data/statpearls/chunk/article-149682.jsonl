TPK is routinely performed for non-resolving microbial keratitis such as bacterial, fungal, acanthamoeba, and viral keratitis.

The patient should be regularly followed up to look for any signs of infection and loose suture removal intermittently, if any. All suture removal can be done in 12 months. If the graft in TPK fails after a period of time, then optical penetrating keratoplasty (OPK) can be attempted 12 months postoperatively once suture removal has been done. OPK can also be attempted in one-eyed patients at 6\u00a0to 8 months. [68]"}

Age and Hormones It is commonly recognized that, in healthy older adults, the effect of aging causes a temporal delay in wound healing but not an actual impairment in terms of healing quality A review of age-related changes in healing capacity demonstrated that every phase of healing undergoes characteristic age-related changes. Compared with females, aged males have been shown to exhibit\u00a0delayed healing of acute wounds. Studies indicate that estrogen can improve the age-related impairment in healing in both men and women, while androgens negatively regulate cutaneous wound healing. [15]"}

Laboratory studies can be a useful adjunct in managing chronic wounds; however, they are often misused, and an evidence-based, rationalized approach is necessary to utilize this expensive resource efficiently. Routine blood work is not required. Serum prealbumin may be valuable in determining nutritional status. A significantly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) can help confirm the diagnosis of osteomyelitis or be used in monitoring response to treatment. [55]"}

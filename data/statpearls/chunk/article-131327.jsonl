The oral cavity receives its sensory innervation from the three branches of the trigeminal nerve. Three types of sensory endings are mainly present in the oral mucosa, consisting of Merkel\u2019s disks, Meissner\u2019s corpuscles, and free nerve endings, which allow the oral mucosa to perceive and respond to the stimulus of temperature, touch, and pain.

During residency training, anesthesiologists have traditionally learned how to place DLTs and BBs on surgical patients under the direction and supervision of experienced faculty. However, more recently, simulators have become available for training in advanced airway techniques, including FOB and the placement of DLTs and BBs, such that trainees may have the opportunities to hone their skills outside the high-stakes environment of the operating room. [10] Current accreditation Counsel for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) requirements include 20 non-cardiac intrathoracic cases. However, there is no specific requirement for lung isolation."}

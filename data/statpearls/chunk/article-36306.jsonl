There is a risorius muscle located on either side of the lips in most individuals. Like other facial muscles, the risorius has a greater percentage of slow muscle fibers and contains a more intricate configuration of innervation of extrafusal fibers than other skeletal muscles throughout the body. Its location is within the deep portion of the superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS), [2] a fibrous network containing the facial muscles, that is continuous with the temporoparietal fascia and galea and extends from the galea aponeurotica and the platysma. Vertical septa connect the SMAS to the dermis. The risorius muscle\u2019s function is to aid in facial expression by pulling the corner of the mouth laterally via its contraction in an outward and upward motion. In conjunction with other facial muscles, this helps to create a smile or a frown, and myriad other expressions in-between.", "contents": "Anatomy, Head and Neck, Risorius Muscle -- Structure and Function.

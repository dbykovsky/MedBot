One or more parathyroid glands may get accidentally resected during surgical intervention on the thyroid.

[1] A population-based study performed by Dr. Hujoel found no correlation between the Chvostek sign and hypocalcemia. Furthermore, for every 1 mg/dl increase in calcium, there was a 4% higher chance of a positive Chvostek sign. It was, in turn, concluded that hypercalcemia had a more significant correlation with facial nerve tetany upon stimulation. Further studies have shown\u00a0that a positive Chvostek sign can be elicited in 25% of healthy individuals, and 29% of those with hypocalcemia did not produce a positive sign.

Capsaicin cream is used for pain relief, especially in arthritis, post-herpetic neuralgia, shingles, fibromyalgia, and peripheral diabetic neuropathy. [73] [74] [75]", "contents": "Biochemistry, Substance P -- Clinical Significance. Capsaicin, a molecule found in chili peppers, has been shown to decrease the amount of SP at the terminal and peripheral nerve endings of afferent nerves. Due to SP's role in pain transmission, capsaicin decreases the awareness of painful stimuli. [70] [71] [72] Capsaicin interferes with a molecule called nerve growth factor (NGF), which is necessary for the synthesis of SP. Capsaicin cream is used for pain relief, especially in arthritis, post-herpetic neuralgia, shingles, fibromyalgia, and peripheral diabetic neuropathy. [73] [74] [75]"}

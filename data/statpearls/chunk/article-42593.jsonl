In 1980, Gallager and Helwig first classified neurothekeomas as dermal tumors of neural origin with characteristic clinical features and distinctive histology. Clinical features included a flesh-colored or slightly erythematous nodule of soft consistency, located on the head, upper extremities, or trunk, and arising more commonly in young females. Histologic features included spindled cells arranged in nests and cords with a mucinous, myxoid background containing dermal collagen bundles. Because the tumor cells appear similar to Schwann cells on electron microscopy (spindle-shaped and surrounded by a basement membrane without myofilament or melanosomes), the authors proposed the name \u201cneurothekeoma\u201d from the Greek word for sheath. [7] In 1986, Rosati et al. reported cases of what they termed cellular neurothekeoma, believing them to be a cellular variant of the previously reported myxoid neurothekeoma. [8] In 1990, Barnhill and Mihm reported on several cases of cellular neurothekeoma, remarking on their histologic similarity to melanocytic tumors as well as commenting on their failure to react with S100 protein immunostain, unlike the original reported myxoid variant of neurothekeoma. Barnhill and Mihm suggested that cellular neurothekeoma represented a distinct sub-category of neurothekeoma, and then in 1991,\u00a0suggested that cellular neurothekeoma might present an entirely separate entity.

[3] [7] [4] [10] In 2005, Fetsch et al. reported on a series of nerve sheath myxomas, the corresponding characteristic immunoprofile, and the tendency of nerve sheath myxoma to arise in different locations and exhibit a higher recurrence rate than neurothekeoma. [11] In 2007, 2 large case studies of neurothekeomas were published separately by Fetsch et al. and Hornick and Fletcher, detailing the immunoprofile of neurothekeoma, further defining the entity as distinctive and separate from nerve sheath myxoma.

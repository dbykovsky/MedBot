In cases of moderate pulmonary regurgitation, the continuous wave Doppler signal density is moderate, and the deceleration rate varies.

Conversely, a right ventricular end-systolic volume <95 mL/m is associated with an increased risk of suboptimal hemodynamic outcomes and adverse clinical events. [38] [48] [85] [86] [87] [88] [89] Importantly, structural valve failure and infective endocarditis are significant long-term complications that may arise after pulmonary valve replacement. Therefore, meticulous follow-up is necessary to monitor these potential complications. [90] [91] [57] [38]"}

Considering the long-term implications of these interventions is crucial, as evidence suggests that survival rates decline significantly after the fifth sternotomy. [92] To mitigate the need for repeated sternotomies, an ideal therapeutic strategy involves a programmatic approach that integrates periodic percutaneous interventions whenever feasible, aiming to prevent sternotomy throughout the patient's lifespan. Ideally, these deliberations are conducted within regularly scheduled, multidisciplinary conferences, allowing all team members to collectively review the patient's workup and contribute their insights and opinions.

Gastric acid is necessary for the activation of pepsinogen, as well as for acidification of the gastric lumen that creates a barrier to the transit of possibly pathogenic bacteria.

Histaminergic stimulation is considered to be the strongest activation pathway for stimulation of gastric acid secretion since parietal cells are contiguous to histamine-secreting enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells. [4] [10] To a lesser extent, gastrin and cholinergic stimulus can activate gastric acid secretion. [4] The main intracellular messenger for hydrochloric acid (HCl) secretion is cyclic AMP (cAMP).

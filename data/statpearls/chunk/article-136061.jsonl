Reproductive health providers\u00a0are especially poised\u00a0for exposure prevention, as they can identify at-risk patients during pre-conception counseling and pregnancy, perhaps even preventing prenatal exposure. Providers can prevent exposure through\u00a0appropriate reporting and patient education. If\u00a0a patient is\u00a0found to have an exposure-related illness\u00a0or suspected exposure based on screening, the case should be referred to occupational medicine programs or an Environmental Health Specialty Unit.

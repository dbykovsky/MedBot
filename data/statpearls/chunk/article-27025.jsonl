Infiltration and Nodularity of Peritoneum). CT scans are highly sensitive in detecting peritoneal lesions, capable of detecting granulations as small as 5 mm. However, the sensitivity decreases as the lesion size decreases. [37] Owing to technical advances, CT has reached a sensitivity of 79% to 86% and specificity of 82% to 89% in the detection of peritoneal involvement;\u00a0but,\u00a0when the lesion size is less than 10 mm, the sensitivity drops to 7% to 28% for lesions 5 mm or less. [35] [38] Despite its nonspecific findings, CT scans commonly reveal ascites, contrast-enhanced diffuse or nodular thickening of the peritoneum, and omental cakes, characterized by increased density of large cell masses between the bowel and anterior abdominal wall. Contrast administration aids in visualizing small peritoneal deposits but may limit the identification of calcified lesions. [39] In primary peritoneal cancer such as EOPPC, CT scan findings typically include ascites (82%), peritoneal nodules (73%), omental caking (64%), and pelvic masses (36%), as reported by Chiou et al. [40] Similarly, in MPM, CT scans reveal solid, heterogeneous masses with irregular margins, often accompanied by ascites in 60% to 100% of cases.\u00a0Notably,\u00a0MPM usually lacks lymph node involvement and distant metastasis. [41] Leiomyosarcomas display contrast-enhanced heterogeneous solid and cystic masses with septations, necrosis, and calcifications.\u00a0Moreover, DSCRTs exhibit well-enhanced lobulated masses comprising necrotic, hemorrhagic, and fibrous components, typically located in the retrovesical or rectouterine space. Overall, CT scans serve as the primary diagnostic modality for peritoneal cancer, providing essential information for guiding interventional radiologists in biopsies and surgeons in\u00a0debulking surgeries."}

This fluid can then be analyzed, providing valuable diagnostic information, including the presence of malignant cells, protein levels, cell counts, and cytological analysis. This fluid removal can also provide symptomatic relief by alleviating abdominal distension and discomfort associated with ascites accumulation. Ascitic fluid analysis Cell analysis Frank bloody ascites are relatively rare in cases of peritoneal carcinomatosis, and they may occur in approximately 10% of cases. Similarly, ascitic fluid that appears blood-tinged, characterized by a high red blood cell count (>10,000 cells/mm), is observed in approximately 8.3% of cases. [44] These findings may be indicative of vascular invasion or hemorrhage within the peritoneal cavity secondary to the presence of malignant cells. Biochemical markers In peritoneal cancer, ascites\u00a0are characterized\u00a0by specific biochemical features that can aid in its diagnosis and differentiation from other causes of abdominal fluid accumulation. Typically, this ascitic fluid is exudative, exhibiting elevated levels of specific biochemical markers: High protein levels\u00a0are typically measured\u00a0at around 2.5 mg/dL. This increase in protein content reflects the leakage of proteins from blood vessels into the peritoneal cavity due to the presence of cancerous cells. Elevated lactate dehydrogenase\u00a0values reach around 400\u00a0IU/L. Lactate dehydrogenase is an enzyme released from damaged or diseased cells, indicating cellular damage or breakdown within the peritoneal cavity. Low glucose levels\u00a0typically measure around 40 mg/dL. This reduction may be attributed to increased glucose consumption by cancer cells or inflammatory processes within the peritoneal cavity. Tumor markers The assessment of tumor markers in both serum and ascites has\u00a0been investigated\u00a0to determine their efficacy in diagnosing malignancies, particularly in cases of peritoneal cancer. Tumor markers such as CEA, CA 19-9, CA-125, and cytokeratin fragments (CYFRA) have\u00a0been studied\u00a0extensively, revealing a high correlation between their levels in ascites and serum. However, it's important to note that while CA-125, CEA, and CYFRA\u00a0are produced\u00a0by normal epithelial cells and can also\u00a0be found\u00a0in certain benign conditions, CYFRA has\u00a0been observed\u00a0to be present in higher quantities in malignant conditions. Initially, results from studies did not find a significant benefit in measuring tumor markers in ascites compared to serum for diagnosing malignancies. [45] However, subsequent research has shown that combining tumor marker analysis with cytology in ascitic fluid can significantly increase the diagnostic yield. Specifically, a combination of\u00a03 tumor markers (CA 19-9, CA 15-3, CEA) has\u00a0been reported\u00a0to demonstrate high sensitivity (86%) and specificity (97%) in cases where cytology results are negative. [46] Furthermore, increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other tumor markers may\u00a0provide additional diagnostic and prognostic information. [47] VEGF is known to promote angiogenesis, facilitating the growth and spread of tumors, and its elevation in ascitic fluid may reflect the aggressive nature of the underlying malignancy. Despite these findings, the significance of measuring tumor markers in ascites remains debatable due to varying results from studies using different cutoff levels for tumor markers. Consequently, it is considered an unproven and potentially unhelpful test due to its low sensitivity. Further research and standardization of protocols may be necessary to establish the clinical utility of tumor marker measurement in ascites for diagnosing peritoneal cancer and other malignancies. Cytology Cytology plays a crucial role in diagnosing malignant-related ascites, with initial specimens yielding positive results in 83% of cases, a rate that increases to 93% and 97% with the submission of\u00a02 and\u00a03 samples, respectively. [44] However, cytology may not provide definitive results in cases of MPM, where sensitivity ranges from 50% to 70%. [44] Subtyping the tumor based on cytology alone can be challenging, necessitating immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for accurate differentiation, grading, and treatment planning. Several specific IHC stains, including calretinin, cytokeratin, and BerEP4, are commonly employed in peritoneal cancer diagnosis. Calretinin, a mesothelial marker, indicates the presence of both\u00a0normal\u00a0and malignant mesothelial cells. Positive staining for calretinin and BerEP4 suggests an epithelial origin, aiding in diagnosing early onset primary peritoneal cancer (eg, EOPPC). MPM typically stains negative for BerEP4 but positive for cytokeratin CK5/6, calretinin, and podoplanin. DSRCT cells stain positive for cytokeratin, desmin, neuron-specific enolase, and WT1. Metastatic adenocarcinomas generally lack nuclear staining for calretinin and cytokeratins. Tumors originating from the upper gastrointestinal tract typically show positivity for CK-7 and varying results for CDX2/CK20, while those from the lower gastrointestinal tract are negative for CK-7 and positive for CDX2/CK20.

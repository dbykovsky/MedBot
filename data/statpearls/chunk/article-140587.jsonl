Autoimmune conditions can have both systemic effects and localized effects. Major clinical features of several major autoimmune diseases in both categories are listed below. It is important to note that this is not an exhaustive list, and even organ-based autoimmune diseases can have varying systemic manifestations as the disease progresses.", "contents": "Biochemistry, Autoimmunity -- Clinical Significance. An estimated 7.6- to 9.5% of the U.S. population reported one of 29 common autoimmune diseases in 2009. [13] The prevalence may potentially be even higher today. Furthermore, autoimmune diseases disproportionately affect females compared to males. [14] An abnormal response to self-antigen recognition at the cellular level translates to a wide variety of clinical manifestations, many of which are debilitating and have a significant impact on quality of life. Autoimmune conditions can have both systemic effects and localized effects. Major clinical features of several major autoimmune diseases in both categories are listed below. It is important to note that this is not an exhaustive list, and even organ-based autoimmune diseases can have varying systemic manifestations as the disease progresses."}

However, in others with features of nephrotic syndrome, remission may take up to 6 months, provided adequate treatment is given. Appropriate treatment does slow the progression of HIV-associated nephropathy, but with progression into ESRD, a kidney transplant may be necessary. Amyloid\u00a0light-chain (AL) amyloidosis takes 2\u00a0to 3 years for progression towards ESRD, while for amyloid\u00a0A (AA) amyloidosis, remission can be achieved by identifying and managing the underlying disease.

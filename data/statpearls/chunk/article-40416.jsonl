Atherosclerosis of the aorta itself is generally\u00a0asymptomatic due to its large caliber. However, marked stenosis of the coronary arteries is responsible for unstable angina and myocardial infarction. Atherosclerosis of the carotid arteries can result in cerebral ischemia, leading to symptoms of a stroke. Peripheral arterial atherosclerosis, also known as peripheral artery disease, can result in limb claudication, tingling, numbness, and non-healing ulcers. Atherosclerosis of the renal arteries often results in chronic kidney disease and renovascular hypertension. Preventative measures include diet, exercise, weight loss, and smoking cessation. Statins, blood pressure medications, and aspirin are the mainstays of treatment. Vascular bypass surgeries can re-establish flow in the limbs, brain, and heart."}

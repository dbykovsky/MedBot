A key aspect to consider is the refraction of light to achieve proper focus on the macula of the eye based on measurements and assessments conducted by ophthalmologists or optometrists."}

For patients with high prescription needs, healthcare team members should inform them about different lens materials, such as high-index lenses that utilize a higher refractive index to achieve thinner spectacle lenses overall.", "contents": "Refractive Index -- Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions.

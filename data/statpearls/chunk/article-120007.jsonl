Topiramate is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, like acetazolamide, increasingly used in epilepsy, as an anticonvulsant, and for migraines. It is also used, off-label, for weight loss and pain management. [52] [68] [69] It causes a mild metabolic acidosis utilizing a mechanism similar to distal renal tubular acidosis, which ultimately results in hypocitraturia, hypercalciuria, hypokalemia, urinary alkalinity, and an increased risk of kidney stones, particularly those composed primarily of calcium phosphate. [70] The degree of hypocitraturia from topiramate varies, but in general, the starting dose of topiramate reduces urinary citrate by about 40%, although this can go up to 65% at higher dosages. [51] [52] For those kidney stone patients who take topiramate and demonstrate hypocitraturia, potassium citrate therapy can increase urinary citrate levels and reverse its other undesirable chemical effects.

The quality and duration of wheezing also depend on where in the airways the obstruction is located. In asthma, the wheezing is due to narrowing of the lower airways, whereas, with malignancies, the obstruction is usually in the upper, more proximal airways. In rare cases, wheezing may be heard both during inspiration and expiration. In severe asthma, no wheeze may be heard as the airflow will be so severely reduced, and chest\u00a0auscultation will be silent.

There are several ways to perform a BKA, one of the most significant differences being guillotine versus completed amputation. Moreover, several designs for skin flaps have been introduced to cover the amputation stump. A long posterior skin flap and unequal (skewed) anterior and posterior muscle and skin (myocutaneous) flaps\u00a0have been widely used. [24] The latter technique has been primarily introduced by Ernest M. Burgess. The Burgess technique was later modified by Lutz Br\u00fcckner to address the specific limitations of occlusive arterial disease. [25]"}

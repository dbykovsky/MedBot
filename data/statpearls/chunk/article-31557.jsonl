[5] There is a recurrence rate of around 30%, although it is likely an underestimate as many people stop diving or they infrequently dive after their initial episode. Therefore, it is difficult to track recurrences. The overall incidence is difficult to assess because the number of fatalities attributed to IPE has been minimal and almost all were in-hospital deaths. This is likely due to the high reliance on bystander reporting of progression of symptoms and early signs since postmortem exam cannot distinguish IPE from other causes of death common in swimming and diving.

{"id": "article-31557_5", "title": "Immersion Pulmonary Edema -- Pathophysiology", "content": "Many factors contribute to the hemodynamic and cardiorespiratory changes that induce leakage of fluid from the capillary into the interstitial space and eventually, into the alveolar airspace. IPE is likely due to stress failure secondary to increased pulmonary vascular resistance, transudative edema, and pulmonary capillary leak. With immersion, there is an increase in pulmonary and systemic arterial pressure caused by passive redistribution of venous blood from the extremities to the heart and pulmonary vessels. This increase in intrathoracic blood volume results in a measured decrease in vital capacity. Cold water will augment this further with a reduction in vital capacity to 91% of baseline and increased shunting centrally as a means of heat conservation. This cold water effect is primarily seen with exposure to the torso and limbs rather than the head. Extreme physical exertion will also increase peripheral vascular resistance (PVR) causing increased afterload as well as increased pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP), and pre-load from redistribution of blood from peripheral to thoracic vessels which are augmented further in cold water immersion. [6] The shunting of blood into the thoracic cavity leads to an increase in hydrostatic pressure in pulmonary capillaries. Increased pre-load, afterload, and hydrostatic pressure in combination with extreme demands on pulmonary capillaries can cause capillary rupture leading to pulmonary edema and hemoptysis. However, there have been cases of IPE in thermoneutral water in individuals who do not exert themselves. This suggests additional mechanisms such as impaired left ventricular function, reversible cardiomyopathies, high blood volume, or high venous tone. In one study, individuals who experienced SIPE were compared against controls measuring mean PAP, PAWP, and PVR during exercise in cold water before and after administration of sildenafil. There was no statistical difference in PAWP and mean PAP between both groups following sildenafil administration suggesting a mechanism during exertion causing a limited increase in left ventricular stroke volume with a relatively greater rise in right ventricular stroke volume causing an increase in hydrostatic pressure and resultant pulmonary edema. Large, negative intrathoracic pressures generated during strenuous exercise, breathing against a closed glottis, or breathing with a malfunctioning regulator may also contribute in some cases. It is also believed that\u00a0breathing dense gas results in decreased alveolar pressure and changes in capillary permeability contributing to the pulmonary edema. There is a neurogenic variant of pulmonary edema previously described in the literature with a rise in catecholamines causing increased pulmonary artery and wedge pressure along with peripheral vasoconstriction. A study monitoring hemodynamic response to immersion demonstrated a wide range of mean PAP and PAWP with some PAP values exceeding 40 mmHg. A pulmonary capillary leak is believed to occur at PAWP 17 to 20 mmHg. Individuals who have had an IPE event demonstrate an exaggerated vasoconstrictive response to cold. When tested in dry conditions, patients with a history of IPE do not exhibit abnormal pulmonary function tests, abnormal exercise capacity, or abnormal pulmonary arterial pressure in response or hypoxemia. Post IPE event evaluation reveals normal PAP, PAWP, echocardiography, lung volumes, spirometry, and diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide. When compared to healthy individuals, those who have a history of IPE had no difference in forearm vascular resistance, left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, and plasma levels of vasoreactive hormones such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, or cortisol.

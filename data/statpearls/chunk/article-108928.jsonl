Increasing the killing capabilities of the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis is desired in treating cancer, and a variety of anticancer drugs increase Fas receptor expression in some tumor cell lines. [15] The TNFRSF member TRAIL has shown some promise in being able to selectively kill cancer cells through binding to multiple receptors (DR4 and DR5). Yet, unfortunately, cancer cells have demonstrated the ability to obtain resistance to death by TRAIL. [16] Conversely, the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis is detrimental in other situations and can be the cause of disease. Extrinsic apoptosis mediated by CTLs has been postulated to cause the damaging effects of liver destruction in chronic viral hepatitis, and CTLs appear to be the cause of Type I diabetes, as the belief is the extrinsic apoptotic pathway initiated by CTLs eliminates the pancreatic beta cells in type I diabetes. [17] Finally, both NK cells and CTLs both contribute to graft-versus-host disease, a significant barrier to the success of bone marrow transplantation."}

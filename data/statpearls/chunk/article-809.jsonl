[15] Upper endoscopies assess the mucosa and submucosa of the esophagus and frequently involve taking biopsies to evaluate esophageal tissue better. A barium swallow study consists of the administration of barium followed by sequential usage of x-rays to determine the movement of barium through the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The test helps to assess the presence of any potential anatomical defects. It also aids in analyzing the physiology of the UES, the esophagus, and the LES. Barium studies, though, are problematic because it is challenging to determine what an average esophageal luminal diameter is. [15] High-resolution manometry involves the use of pressure-sensitive catheters to evaluate both the sphincter and the esophageal motor function. By moving the catheter sequentially down the esophagus and its associated sphincters, the pressure-sensitive catheter picks up the pressure changes as the sphincters open and close, or as peristalsis occurs. [16] Ultrasound is another useful, readily available test that helps evaluate the function of the esophagus. Unfortunately, it has not gained wide popularity for assessing the esophagus yet. [15]"}

It can occur either while initiating the swallow or shortly thereafter. The former is referred to as oropharyngeal dysphagia and occurs when there is a problem at the level of the oropharynx, as the name implies. The latter happens due to problems in the esophagus, hence the name esophageal dysphagia. There are several mechanisms by which esophageal dysphagia occurs. Physical obstruction and motor problems are the two most common causes of dysphagia. They can occur at the level of the UES, the esophagus itself, or the LES. Diffuse esophageal spasm, achalasia, scleroderma, and diabetes mellitus are common causes of dysphagia owing to a motor problem. Esophageal carcinoma, reflux esophagitis, peptic strictures, or Schatski\u2019s rings, on the other hand, are examples of conditions causing dysphagia due to an obstructive process. Esophageal obstructions cause difficulty swallowing to liquids initially that eventually progresses to dysphagia to both liquids and solids. In contrast, motor diseases cause dysphagia to both solids and liquids from the beginning. [4]", "contents": "Physiology, Esophagus -- Pathophysiology.

With improved surgical and organ preservation strategies, a heart transplant is an option for eligible patients. To derive good outcomes, the goals and objectives of the heart transplantation have to be defined prior to taking the patient to surgery. In some cases, chronic infections, cirrhosis, and chronic kidney diseases, as well as psychosocial factors, may preclude cardiac transplants. Proper screening is thus required for proper patient selection. As with any other complex procedure, the preoperative workup must be thorough, and the patient should be seen by a pulmonologist and cardiologist to optimize lung and cardiac function. Due to the potential of complications from immunosuppression and the procedure itself, routine surveillance and biopsies are recommended.

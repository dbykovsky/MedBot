Glenoid bony defects less than 25 degrees can be managed by eccentric reaming and bone graft. For example,\u00a0if there is a bone loss from the superior glenoid, the upward tilt of the glenoid component is avoided by reaming inferiorly and superior bone graft insertion to maintain the desired inferior tilt of 10 degrees. Glenoid bony defect larger than 25 degrees requires a patient-specific graft prepared using preoperative 3D planning software."}

Better outcomes are associated with immediate admission to a dedicated neuroscience intensive care. [49]"}
{"id": "article-28384_28", "title": "Stroke Reperfusion Injury -- Treatment / Management", "content": "Supportive management of an I/R injury could include aiming for normovolemia, normotension, avoidance of hypoglycemia, antiepileptic drugs (can be considered if there are any seizures), and maintenance of cerebral perfusion pressure >70mmHg, amongst others. If there is significant edema associated with clinical decompensation, the use of osmotic therapies like mannitol and/or hypertonic saline can be considered. On the contrary, Mannitol could also increase hemorrhagic risk due to vessel damage and its osmotic effect. [50] In some clinical settings with impending herniation/herniation or clinical decompensation associated with elevated intracranial pressures, decompressive hemicraniectomy is utilized and has been shown to improve outcomes. Of note, the data above about the acute use of osmotic therapies in cerebral edema is from studies on stroke in general and not specifically related to reperfusion injury per se. Steroids are contraindicated in such presentations and have been associated with worse outcomes.", "contents": "Stroke Reperfusion Injury -- Treatment / Management.

Explosions occur due to an exothermic reaction generated when chemical bonds are disrupted. This ultimately causes the solid or liquid explosive material to be converted to a gas, rapidly expanding and releasing much energy. The explosion created by an IED can be classified into high-energy, which creates a supersonic high-pressure blast wave, or low-energy explosion, which creates a subsonic explosion without a blast wave. Examples of high-energy explosives include TNT, C4, Semtex, nitroglycerin, dynamite, and ammonia nitrate fuel oil. In contrast, materials like gunpowder and petroleum are examples of substances that cause low-energy explosions. Upon contact with a target, a significant amount of kinetic energy is dispersed, leading to the injury patterns described below.

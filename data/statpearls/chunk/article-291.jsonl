Gynecomastia is a benign proliferation of breast tissue driven by the increased estrogen receptor expression secondary to alteration in hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA) axis function. Estradiol nuclear and cellular receptor concentrations were similarly elevated in AAS users with pre-malignant soft tissue proliferation of the breast and patients with benign breast tissue proliferation, not due to AAS use. [23] The only definitive way to treat gynecomastia is the cessation of steroid use and surgical excision."}

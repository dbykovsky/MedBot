One of the most dangerous anomalies of origin of the LAD is when the LAD originates off\u00a0the pulmonary artery, which is a very rare anomaly that can lead to myocardial injury and potential death. [3] Patients tend to experience symptoms early in life. Approximately 90% of untreated infants die in the 1st year of life, and only a few patients survive to adulthood.

The LAD can also originate from the right sinus of Valsalva and has been known to correlate with double outlet right ventricle, tetralogy of Fallot, and transposition complexes.

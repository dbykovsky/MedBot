Opportunistic pathogens such as Mycobacterium , fungi, viruses, parasites can cause latent or subacute infections in HIV/AIDS patients. Due to an immunodeficient state and lack of inflammatory response, the patient can remain asymptomatic.\u00a0Following the initiation of HAART, however, there is an anticipated improvement in an immune-mediated inflammatory response. This hyper-inflammatory response is the hallmark of IRIS. The clinical presentation depends on the underlying pathogen and organ/system involved and the severity of the inflammatory response. [30]"}

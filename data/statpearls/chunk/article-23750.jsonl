[37] The differentiation of physiologic and allergic-like reactions serves to guide treatment and pretreatment recommendations. Allergy-like reactions are well defined and described in the American College of Radiology manual on contrast media. Mild reactions are self-limiting. Moderate symptoms can progress if therapy reis not initiated. Mild to moderate allergic reactions include; diffuse edema, facial edema without dyspnea, pruritus, urticaria, itchy throat, nasal congestion, diffuse erythema, conjunctivitis, bronchospasm, wheezing, or mild hypoxia. Severe reactions require intervention and can be life-threatening if not treated appropriately. Severe reactions include diffuse edema or facial edema with dyspnea, erythema with hypotension, laryngeal edema with stridor, wheezing, or bronchospasm with significant hypoxia or anaphylactic shock.

The spatial resolution is higher with fluoroscopic angiography; however, the ability to define surrounding structures or contrast resolution is far superior to CT. While many studies came from the fluoroscopy suite, CT angiography has become the standard in many situations."}

Fluoroscopic evaluation utilizes small intravascular boluses administered in real-time by a physician. The real-time evaluation allows the physician to adapt the study to the findings, allowing targeted evaluation of multiple areas and more judicious use of contrast. CT temporal resolution is limited to a few time points that can be assessed but can cover larger areas with the larger boluses utilized.

A classic scenario is the MRI of the head and neck to evaluate vasculature following a transient ischemic attack. One advantage of utilizing MRI is that some vasculature can be evaluated without contrast, utilizing the flow properties of moving blood. [72] While this method is useful when renal function prohibits CT or MRI contrast, it may be riddled with artifacts and is not the diagnostic image of choice.\u00a0 The MRI evaluation of the neck can be with and without contrast, with some institutions utilizing both methods to account for various forms of artifacts that can confound one method versus another.

Nasal adverse reactions: Fluticasone may lead to epistaxis, nasal erosions, ulcerations, and septal perforations. Patients using fluticasone for extended periods should be monitored for changes in nasal mucosa. If septal perforation occurs, fluticasone should be discontinued. Immunosuppression and infection: Fluticasone may increase susceptibility to infections. Caution is advised in patients with active infections or prior corticosteroid treatment."}

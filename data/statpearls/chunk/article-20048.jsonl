Echocardiography can be done to assess the ejection fraction and other associated structural anomalies if present, such as aortic regurgitation, mitral valve regurgitation, and ventricular systolic dysfunction. Electrocardiography is an essential tool to monitor dynamic changes in ST and T waves, which could detect conduction anomalies such as sinus tachycardia, ectopic beats, heart block, and myocardial infarction as well.

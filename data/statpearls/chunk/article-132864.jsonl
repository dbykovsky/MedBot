If requiring PH treatment, iNO can be initiated for those patients with a normal functioning LV, whereas milrinone may be more appropriate for those neonates with comorbid LV diastolic dysfunction. [2] Milrinone in this setting can additionally act as a lusitrope to increase LV filling and reduce the left-to-right shunt via the PFO. If no response is seen with these agents, a second-line agent may be administered, such as a prostacyclin or a phosphodiesterase inhibitor."}

Lung fields should be regularly assessed for any evidence of pneumothorax, hemorrhage, or atelectasis. Postoperative care will continue in the NICU with the patient intubated and mechanically ventilated. Ventilatory and hemodynamic support is weaned as tolerated. A multimodal pain regimen may include opioids, an epidural, and acetaminophen if liver function tests are normal.

Both 2-D and 3-D echocardiography can be valuable in visualizing the double-orifice mitral valve and assessing its structure and function.", "contents": "Double Orifice Mitral Valve -- Pearls and Other Issues. Key facts to keep in mind about\u00a0double-orifice mitral valves are as follows: Double-orifice mitral valve can present with variable anatomy. The\u00a02 orifices may be of equal size or different sizes, and they may be side by side or separated by a bridge of tissue. It is common for a double-orifice mitral valve to be associated with other congenital heart anomalies, such as atrioventricular septal defects or papillary muscles and chordae tendineae abnormalities. The functional impact of a double-orifice mitral valve can vary. In some cases, it may not cause significant hemodynamic effects or symptoms. However, it can contribute to mitral regurgitation or stenosis in other instances. Diagnosis is typically confirmed through cardiac imaging studies, including echocardiography. Both 2-D and 3-D echocardiography can be valuable in visualizing the double-orifice mitral valve and assessing its structure and function."}

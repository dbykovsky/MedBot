These act on the alpha-one receptors of the arterioles to cause arteriolar constriction. This is a valuable adaptation to prevent excessive heat loss from the fingers and toes. However, in more extreme environments, this process can lead to the loss of fingers and toes due to gangrene from frostbite.", "contents": "Anatomy, Shoulder and Upper Limb, Forearm Radial Artery -- Clinical Significance -- Arteriolar Constriction in a Cold Environment. In a cold environment, the arterioles of the arteries supplying the hand contract under the influence of norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and epinephrine (adrenaline). These act on the alpha-one receptors of the arterioles to cause arteriolar constriction. This is a valuable adaptation to prevent excessive heat loss from the fingers and toes. However, in more extreme environments, this process can lead to the loss of fingers and toes due to gangrene from frostbite."}

The loss of bone mass with age makes this fracture more common in senior citizens, who also may have a tendency to fall.\u00a0If the scaphoid is fractured, it is imperative to diagnose the fracture of the scaphoid and splint the wrist. A complication is that the fracture may not show up on a radiograph for as much as a week to ten days when the bone has degenerated enough for the fracture to be visible.\u00a0A scaphoid fracture can be diagnosed by putting manual pressure on the scaphoid at the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb in the anatomical snuffbox. Pain will be elicited by this maneuver if the scaphoid is fractured. If the wrist is not splinted in the case of a scaphoid fracture, the fractured portion may lose its blood supply and form a permanent non-union of the fracture. The fractured bone will become avascularized, undergoing degeneration which can be a permanent source of pain and disability.", "contents": "Anatomy, Shoulder and Upper Limb, Forearm Radial Artery -- Clinical Significance -- Fracture of the Scaphoid.

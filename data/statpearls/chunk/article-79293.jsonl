Both types have similar presentations to other disease states; however, there will often be a unique history given as well as distinct radiographic and histologic findings that are important clues in the diagnosis of this rare form of pneumonia. Increased awareness of this disease by physicians and patients is vital, given the growing number of cases in our society due to electronic cigarette use and inhalation of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) containing oils. Lipoid pneumonia is poorly understood in the medical community, and due to the high number of underreported and undiagnosed cases, there is currently very little research on the subject.

Initial treatment includes rest, physical rehabilitation, orthotic measures (e.g., splints, foot care, limb supports), avoidance of the aggravating activity, and pain relievers for neuropathic pain (e.g., analgesics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, corticosteroids, anesthetics). [3] [18] [4] [17] [8] [28] For athletes, it may be necessary to change the method of training and using sports equipment. Supportive braces and specialized gloves may also be helpful. [4] Reversible causes should be corrected. For example, in cases where the peripheral nerve injury is due to nerve compression due to hematoma, urgent surgical decompression may be considered [18] [9] ; in nerve compression secondary to fracture, surgical management may be required [27] ; in compartment syndrome, fasciotomy. [4] [9] If there is no clinical improvement in 6 weeks, an electrodiagnostic study is useful to evaluate for the degree of nerve injury. [3] [4]"}

The motor response is called compound muscle action potential (CMAP). CMAP reflects the sum of motor unit potentials stimulated. The amplitude is directly proportional to the number of depolarized axons. When the amplitude of the CMAP no longer changes, this means that all the axons are stimulated. On the other hand, the sensory response is called sensory nerve action potential (SNAP). SNAPs aid in determining whether the lesion is post-ganglionic or pre-ganglionic, which ultimately helps in localizing proximal lesions. The parameters measured in NCS are amplitude, latency (the time it takes to generate a response [i.e., CMAP or SNAP] from the time of administering the stimulus), and conduction velocity. In neurapraxia, CMAP and SNAP can be elicited distal to the injury. Proximally, NCV shows partial or complete conduction block, varying degrees of decreased CMAP and SNAP amplitude, and reduced conduction velocity. When remyelination is complete, these changes improve completely or partially. [7] [5] [30]", "contents": "Neuroanatomy, Neurapraxia -- Other Issues.

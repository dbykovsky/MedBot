The first-pass effect decreases the active drug's concentration upon reaching systemic circulation or its site of action. The first-pass effect is often associated with the liver, a major site of drug metabolism. However, the first-pass effect can also occur in the body's lungs, vasculature, gastrointestinal tract, and other metabolically active tissues. This effect can be increased by various factors such as plasma protein concentrations, gastrointestinal motility, and enzymatic activity.

Some drugs that undergo considerable first-pass metabolism include alprenolol, 5-fluorouracil, morphine, pentazocine, and mercaptopurine. When given orally, these drugs are quickly metabolized via the first-pass effect, requiring their oral dosages to be much larger than their intravenous dosages.

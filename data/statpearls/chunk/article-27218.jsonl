However, it is essential to note that pilocarpine may affect the M1-M3 receptor subtypes, which causes parasympathetic side effects later discussed in this paper. The M3 receptor is an excitatory receptor expressed in gastric glands, salivary glands, and smooth muscle cells, such as those in the pupillary sphincter and ciliary bodies. By stimulating the Gq receptor, the M3 receptor can activate phospholipase C. This leads to the creation of the second messenger's inositol triphosphate, diacylglycerol, and calcium and protein kinase. [3] Therefore, M3 cholinergic agonists result in the upregulation of calcium and, ultimately, smooth muscle contraction, such as in the pupillary sphincter muscle.

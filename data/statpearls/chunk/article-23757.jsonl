Considering this fact makes it easier to understand that health care workers are at low risk of radiation exposure in nuclear medicine as compared to interventional lab staff, and that is the reason that their effective dose is highly unlikely to exceed occupational dose limits. The highest radiation exposure in nuclear medicine is associated with exposure to positron emission tomography (PET) pharmaceuticals. Out of all PET pharmaceuticals, Technetium 99m carries the highest risk of radiation exposure. [31] The mean daily effective dose for PET technologists is approximately 14 mSv, and the effective dose per minute of close contact (<2 m) with a radioactive source is approximately 0.5 mSv/min.

Thrombocytopenia is a platelet count <150,000 cells/\u00b5L. Patients with congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia typically exhibit severe thrombocytopenia, often with a platelet count of less than 21,000 cells/\u03bcL, presenting either at birth or within the initial month of life. Occasionally, affected infants develop findings during fetal development. Common manifestations include purpura, intracranial bleeding, recurrent rectal bleeding, or pulmonary hemorrhage within hours of birth. [4] [10] A family history of thrombocytopenia may be present. [4] No characteristic congenital phenotypic abnormalities are associated with congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia. Some studies note neurological defects\u00a0such as strabismus, cerebellar agenesis, hypoplasia of the corpus callosum and brainstem, facial malformations, and cortical dysplasia. The underlying mechanism of these neurological findings is unclear. One possibility is that the absence or deficiency of MPL in the brain, as observed in congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia, can lead to developmental delay. The other hypothesis considers the long-term sequelae due to intracranial bleeding. [3] [5] [10] [11] [36]"}

Surgical resection is the standard of care in resectable colon cancer.\u00a0The resection type, lymphadenectomy extent, and specific techniques depend on the location and stage of the tumor. Adjuvant chemotherapy is indicated in a subset of more advanced colon cancers. Patients with metastatic disease are managed with systemic therapy. Radiation is seldom used in colon cancer. In some cases, surgical procedures may be employed to provide palliative relief for patients with advanced colon cancer."}

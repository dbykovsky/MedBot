This dimeric IgA binds to the polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR) at the basolateral surface of intestinal epithelial cells to enter the cell via transcytosis. [6] It is shuffled across the cell, and the polymeric Ig receptor still bound to IgA is cleaved at the apical surface to form the secretory component. Thus, pIgR transports dimeric IgA to the mucosal lumen where it gets released as secretory IgA (SIgA), which comprises dimeric IgA, the J chain, and the secretory component deriving from PIgR.

Baricitinib is orally administered and gets rapidly absorbed leading to a peak concentration within 60 minutes, food appears to have no effect on the pharmacokinetics of the medication. The pharmacokinetics of Baricitinib follows a linear curve and there is no accumulation of clinical significance. It is moderately distributed into tissues with 50% binding to plasma proteins and a volume of distribution of 1.1L [6] . Baricitinib is cleared by the kidneys by the process of active secretion and filtration. Naturally, its half-life is extended in patients with renal failure or ESRD. It is cleared efficiently with hemodialysis, however, the data on its clearance with continuous renal replacement and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is slim. The manufacturers have advised against the use of Baricitinib in patients with end-stage renal disease. This may cause a problem in critically ill patients requiring these modalities of rescue therapy. It is also unclear if Baricitinib can be administered to pregnant or breastfeeding patients with lacking data on whether it crosses the placenta or if it causes any fetal toxicity. Uniquely, Baricitinib can cause a rapid rise in the platelet count that is not seen in any other JAK inhibitors [21] .

Baricitinib is a relatively new drug, and our knowledge about its safety and efficacy profile will build over time. Baricitinib is orally administered and gets rapidly absorbed leading to a peak concentration within 60 minutes, food appears to have no effect on the pharmacokinetics of the medication. The pharmacokinetics of Baricitinib follows a linear curve and there is no accumulation of clinical significance. It is moderately distributed into tissues with 50% binding to plasma proteins and a volume of distribution of 1.1L [6] . Baricitinib is cleared by the kidneys by the process of active secretion and filtration. Naturally, its half-life is extended in patients with renal failure or ESRD. It is cleared efficiently with hemodialysis, however, the data on its clearance with continuous renal replacement and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is slim. The manufacturers have advised against the use of Baricitinib in patients with end-stage renal disease. This may cause a problem in critically ill patients requiring these modalities of rescue therapy. It is also unclear if Baricitinib can be administered to pregnant or breastfeeding patients with lacking data on whether it crosses the placenta or if it causes any fetal toxicity.

Based on our existing knowledge of the medication it is evident that the common side effects are upper airway infections and headaches [21] .

It is\u00a0well-recognized that when upper eyelid surgery is\u00a0performed\u00a0with or without ptosis repair, the position of the brows will drop, unmasking the brow ptosis, especially in men. [9] The symmetry of the upper eyelids or lack of it needs to be measured and documented.\u00a0 The amount of upper eyelid skin excess, it\u2019s thickness, evidence of any inflammation or presence of skin lesions should be noted. It is important to look for and document facial (brow, eyelid but also forehead and cheek) asymmetry. In Asians and certain other populations, epiblepharon may be present and should be noted as the placement of the upper eyelid incision will affect the eventual scar and result. Patients may have one or more (primary, secondary, tertiary) skin creases and the creases may be asymmetric."}

This is where the experience of the surgeon is important as a number of factors affect the height of the upper eyelid and its ability to close. Peroperatively, local anesthetic injections will partially paralyze the orbicularis muscle, giving the levator a mechanical functional advantage. If there is diffusion of any anesthetic into the levator and M\u00fcller\u2019s muscle, the lid elevation will be affected. Most surgeons will aim for a slight lagophthalmos on the table, especially when ptosis correction is also undertaken. Topical lubricants with drops and ointment are useful for the first few days to weeks until the lagophthalmos resolves."}

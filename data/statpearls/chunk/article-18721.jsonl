Another pitfall in the immediate stage of the injury is not debriding particulate matter from the eye, particularly from the superior fornix. Residual particulate matter causes persistent inflammation. A valuable tool to help manage the initial hospital-based irrigation is a commercially available lens that can be applied to the eye and connected to intravenous line tubing to allow hands-free irrigation. If such a commercial lens is not available, adequate, timely irrigation will require an attendant present at the patient\u2019s side to thoroughly irrigate the ocular surface. Topical anesthesia is almost always necessary during irrigation and assessment.", "contents": "Ocular Burns -- Pearls and Other Issues.

Prehospital providers must ensure a safe environment for themselves and the injured patient by performing adequate decontamination. Early communication with the hospital-based team must include information about patient stability, mental status, any concerns for airway involvement, the suspected extent of injury, and information about the chemical agent if known. This will allow for the emergency department to be prepared for patient arrival. After the acute care providers have stabilized the patient, adequately irrigated the eyes, decontaminated the patient, and assessed the extent of injuries, a call must be placed to ophthalmology to discuss further care. Early consultation with ophthalmology will optimize patient care in the immediate stage when initial care is being provided by a generalist like the emergency medicine physician. Coordinated care with the hospital pharmacist may be needed to ensure the patient has access to the appropriate therapeutic agents in the early acute phase of the injury.", "contents": "Ocular Burns -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

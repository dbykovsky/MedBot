[171] Testicular torsion has a significant impact on the patient's future fertility and can be associated with psychological trauma. [172] Surgical intervention in testicular torsion has to be prompt. There is a 90 to 100% salvage rate if operation occurs within 6 hours of the onset of testicular torsion. The salvage rate reduces with time. [173]"}

For instance, a dilated pupil may alter the responses on an ERG, a test measuring the electrical responses of various cell types in the retina, including photoreceptors (rods and cones), inner retinal cells (bipolar and amacrine cells), and the ganglion cells. In visual field testing and during manifest refraction, a smaller pupil size may introduce a \"pinhole effect,\" potentially affecting the test results.", "contents": "The Effect of Pupil Size on Visual Resolution -- Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions.

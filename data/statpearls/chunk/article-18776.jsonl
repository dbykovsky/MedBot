Currently, there are ten known subtypes of voltage-gated calcium channels, each with a different molecular structure and variations in subunit composition. [19] [20] All voltage-gated calcium channels contain one of ten different a1 subunits. The a1 subunit that a particular VGCC channel contains determines to which subtype the channel belongs. In addition to the a1 subunit, there are also four auxiliary subunits: A beta (B), a2, delta, and a gamma subunit, with the a2 and delta subunits connected by a disulfide bond. [21] [19] [22] The auxiliary subunits are not present in every subtype of voltage-gated calcium channels. Instead, different subtypes are composed of different combinations of these subunits. Furthermore, there are different subtypes of the auxiliary subunits, with ten distinct a1 subunits, four distinct beta subunits, and four distinct a2d subunits that have so far been identified. [19] [20] Voltage-gated calcium channels subdivide into three main classes: Cav1, Cav2, Cav3, which represent L-types (Cav1.1-1.4), P/Q-type (Cav2.1), N-Type (Cav2.2), R-type (Cav2.3), and T-type (Cav3.1\u20133.3) based on the particular a1 subunit. For example, the Cav2.2 N-type VGCC contains the Cav2.2 a1 subunit. The a1 subunit present in a particular subtype of VGCC is the main determining factor that dictates a channel's biophysical and pharmacological properties. [20] [23]"}

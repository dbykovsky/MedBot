During this process (and as soon as the heart stops beating in the donor and normal circulatory perfusion is halted), the kidneys experience ischemia. Cold ischemia time begins as soon as normal perfusion stops and ends when the kidney is reperfused in its recipient \u2013 the kidney should be on the ice for as much of this time as possible to diminish metabolic demand and minimize injury.\u00a0 Warm ischemia time is considered more harmful to the organ. It is classically described as the \u201csew-in\u201d time when the organ is removed from cold storage until it is ultimately reperfused following vascular anastomosis.\u00a0 It is important to remember that there is also a period of upfront warm ischemia involved in the DCD donation process between when the patient experiences circulatory arrest and the aorta is cannulated and flushed with the preservative solution and the organs are topically cooled with ice."}

Of paramount importance is that the team leader can effectively communicate with each team member and rapidly asses the skill levels and knowledge present within those team members.[23] By\u00a0designing team-based medical scenarios, instructors are more easily able to teach and assess learner communication and leadership skills.

Management of emergent\u00a0medical cases is at the crux and the\u00a0focal point\u00a0of emergency medicine resident training.\u00a0Simulation has the added benefit of allowing medical\u00a0providers to practice stressful and high-risk scenarios in an environment that is safe for the patient and safe for the practitioners.

The learner would be expected to proceed through the cognitive process of identifying the causes of PEA arrest and working through the treatments of those causes. The instructor may design the case so that any of the causes of PEA arrest is the causative factor, and the case scenario would end when the learner correctly treats the rhythm.

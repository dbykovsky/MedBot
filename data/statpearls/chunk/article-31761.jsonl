This law covers civil liability or \"wrongdoing.\" Specific words and wording in the world of law have very precise meanings, regardless of how they are used in common everyday conversation. For example, intention means one has the goal of harming and has been thought out (i.,e. battery\u00a0and wrongful imprisonment); whereas negligence does not require intent to do any arm or forethought, it can be considered a \"mistake,\" that can be cognitive, physical, or knowledgeable. This is the most concerning type of law and lawsuit in which EMS will be involved. For a person to make a claim of negligence by their EMS provider, they need to prove that there was a duty to the patient. This can be written, verbal, or implied. This means that there needs to be, for lack of a better term when talking about the law, a contract of care. This specific aspect is what is brought up when abandonment of care is discussed. Secondly, the patient\u00a0must show or prove that the duty to care was breached or not done. The phrase most used is that \"a reasonable, prudent provider of similar education and experience would have acted the same way.\" This is the definition of standard of care. The standard of care is dependent on each case and, if brought to court, is decided by the jury.\u00a0Physicians that are medical directors of an agency or provide medical command could be named and involved in a lawsuit for the actions of EMS providers under their command/control.", "contents": "EMS Legal and Ethical Issues -- Issues of Concern.

Histologically, it appears as sheets of polygonal cells surrounded by fibrous stroma with areas of eosinophilic amyloid-like materials. Calcification is a distinctive feature and usually develops within the amyloid-like material and forms rings, known as Liesegang\u2019s rings. The exact nature of the eosinophilic material is controversial as it does not stain as amyloid when exposed to Congo red. However, it exhibits apple-green birefringence when seen by polarized light. This material may represent enamel protein that is secreted by the tumor cells. [41]"}

Trismus\u00a0most commonly occurs in the setting\u00a0of\u00a0uncomplicated common\u00a0conditions (e.g., wisdom tooth extraction); it may also be a\u00a0relatively common complication of uncommon diseases (fibrosis following head and neck radiotherapy). Trismus is best addressed by identifying the inciting etiology and directing treatment to the underlying cause. Most cases of trismus resolve following symptom-directed treatment with heat therapy and NSAIDs. Refractory chronic trismus may require physiotherapeutic interventions. Implementing a checklist to identify cases of trismus with an atypical presentation may\u00a0help identify cases of malignancy at early stages. Mandibular opening devices are usually prescribed by a specialist or physiotherapist."}

Physiatrists may also be involved in a patient's care when directed therapeutic interventions are necessary to treat refractory trismus. [1] The outcomes are good if the primary cause can be treated. However, in patients with severe trauma, scarring, and radiation therapy, trismus may be chronic and lead to poor quality of life.

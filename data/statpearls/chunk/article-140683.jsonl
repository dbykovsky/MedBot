An important mechanism that leads to malnutrition in patients with systemic disorders is the underlying inflammatory response. Many conditions like cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic pancreatitis, neuromuscular disorders, etc., have some underlying chronic inflammatory response, which leads to an altered metabolic state. Another mechanism that could lead to nutritional disturbances is malabsorption. Many gastrointestinal pathologies such as inflammatory bowel disease, pernicious anemia, celiac disease, gastrointestinal obstruction, pancreatitis, and liver cirrhosis can lead to malnutrition through this mechanism. Malabsorption can also occur because of conditions affecting other organ systems. For example, right-sided congestive cardiac failure may be associated with intestinal edema, resulting in malabsorption and malnutrition in these patients. The next mechanism is metabolic disturbances observed in conditions characterized by dysfunction of the liver, gallbladder, and pancreas and endocrine disorders like diabetes mellitus, Cushing syndrome, and hyperthyroidism. Malnutrition also occurs due to decreased nutrient intake or loss of nutrients. Poor intake of nutrients can be seen in local pathologies affecting ingestion of food, as well as diseases that have dementia as one of the clinical features, such as Parkinson and Alzheimer diseases. [31] Recurrent nausea or vomiting, which leads to either decrease in the nutrient intake or loss of nutrients, can be seen in gastrointestinal pathologies, cyclic vomiting syndrome, brain tumors, Meniere disease, allergies, migraines, and motion sickness. Similarly, conditions characterized by recurrent diarrhea or steatorrhea can also be associated with malnutrition due to loss of nutrients.

[32]", "contents": "Nutritional Assessment -- Issues of Concern -- Factors Affecting Nutritional Status. Medical and surgical illnesses: Various medical and surgical illnesses affect the nutritional status of individuals through multiple mechanisms and may lead to malnutrition. An important mechanism that leads to malnutrition in patients with systemic disorders is the underlying inflammatory response. Many conditions like cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic pancreatitis, neuromuscular disorders, etc., have some underlying chronic inflammatory response, which leads to an altered metabolic state. Another mechanism that could lead to nutritional disturbances is malabsorption. Many gastrointestinal pathologies such as inflammatory bowel disease, pernicious anemia, celiac disease, gastrointestinal obstruction, pancreatitis, and liver cirrhosis can lead to malnutrition through this mechanism. Malabsorption can also occur because of conditions affecting other organ systems. For example, right-sided congestive cardiac failure may be associated with intestinal edema, resulting in malabsorption and malnutrition in these patients. The next mechanism is metabolic disturbances observed in conditions characterized by dysfunction of the liver, gallbladder, and pancreas and endocrine disorders like diabetes mellitus, Cushing syndrome, and hyperthyroidism. Malnutrition also occurs due to decreased nutrient intake or loss of nutrients. Poor intake of nutrients can be seen in local pathologies affecting ingestion of food, as well as diseases that have dementia as one of the clinical features, such as Parkinson and Alzheimer diseases.

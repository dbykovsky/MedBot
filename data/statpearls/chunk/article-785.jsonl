The myofibril is divided\u00a0further into individual sarcomeres consisting of thick filaments and thin filaments. The thin filaments contain actin, tropomyosin, and troponin, whereas myosin forms the thick filaments, which is stabilized by a protein called titin. Muscle contraction occurs when myosin forms cross-bridges with actin and utilizes the energy provided by hydrolysis of ATP to generate active tension by pulling on actin. Tropomyosin is complexed with troponin and prevents cross-bridge formation by blocking myosin-binding sites on actin. Troponin consists of three subunits: 1) troponin T, which anchors the complex to tropomyosin, 2) troponin I, which binds to actin and blocks the myosin-binding sites, and\u00a03) troponin C which binds to calcium. When calcium binds to troponin C, the tropomyosin-troponin unit changes its conformation leading to exposure of these binding sites, which allows contraction to occur.

Increases in preload stretch the ventricular myocytes to a length closer to the optimum value leading to an increase in active tension. It is unclear exactly how changes in sarcomere length alter the strength of contraction. The initial line of thought was that changing the length of sarcomeres influences the overlap between thick and thin filaments, causing different amounts of cross-bridge cycling.

Figure 2 demonstrates this in a graphical representation. The transverse axis represents preload, often measured as LVEDV or LVEDP, and the longitudinal axis is stroke volume. As passive tension due to LVEDV or LVEDP increases, the active contraction is stronger, leading to higher stroke volume and cardiac output.\u00a0This increased stroke volume is represented by moving along various points on the green curve and appears similar to the length-tension relationship (image 1). Changes in contractility cause the normal curve to shift up or down, meaning there is a difference in contractility for any given preload. Of note, there is a plateau of the Frank-Starling relationship at higher amounts of preload, which might be due to increases in sarcomere length that exceed the optimal value leading to decreases in the affinity of calcium for troponin. The plateau is also attributable to the use of LVEDP instead of LVEDV in clinical practice because of its ease of measurement. In a healthy heart, LVEDP is strongly correlated with LVEDV. Decreases in compliance, often seen in heart disease, can lead to high LVEDP at lower LVEDV. As a result, there is very little stretching to produce the length-dependent activation observed in the Frank-Starling relationship.", "contents": "Physiology, Starling Relationships -- Clinical Significance.

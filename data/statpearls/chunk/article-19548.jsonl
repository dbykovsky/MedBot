The word chyle is derived from the\u00a0 Greek word \u201cChylos,\u201d which means juice. Chyle is the milky bodily fluid formed in the lacteal system of the intestine. The small and medium-chain triglycerides consumed in the diet are easily broken to free fatty acids by the intestinal enzymes and readily absorbed into the portal circulation. However, the large molecules of complex long-chain triglycerides cannot be broken down by the intestinal lipases. They combine with phospholipids, cholesterol, and cholesterol esters to form chylomicrons in the jejunum. These large molecules then get absorbed into the lymphatic\u00a0system of the small intestine to form the chyle. The lymphatic drainage system of the intestine will be joined by the lymphatic\u00a0drainage from the lower extremities to form the thoracic duct system, which ultimately drains in the system circulation. If there is a breach of the integrity of the thoracic duct, the milky lipid-rich chyle leaks to the surrounding structures. Chylothorax is formed when the chyle leaks into the pleural cavity due to damage to the thoracic duct. As the normal chyle production is around 2.4 liters per day, a considerable amount of chyle can accumulate in the pleural cavity in a very short period. Chylothorax was first described in the 17th century by Dr. Bartloet and, in the last decade, has received special attention due to the innovation of new management strategies with favorable outcomes.

Measurement of the pleural fluid triglyceride content is key to the diagnosis of suspected chylothorax. Unlike in any other body fluids, chylothorax is very rich in large chain fatty acids absorbed from the small intestine. The pleural fluid triglyceride concentration greater than 110 mg/dL confirms the diagnosis of chylothorax. However, 15% of chylothorax are known to have triglyceride concentrations less than 110 mg depending on the time of the last meal and the fat content of the diet. If clinical suspicion of chylothorax is high, then lipid electrophoresis of the pleural fluid should be done. Detection of chylomicrons in the pleural fluid by lipoprotein electrophoresis confirms chylothorax. Typically, the total cholesterol level in a chylothorax is less than 200 mg/dl."}

Intratympanic steroids have minimal morbidity; however, there are some potential complications or side effects that must be considered and thoroughly discussed with the patient before undergoing the procedure. The most common side effects are\u00a0transient dizziness, injection site pain, and a burning sensation. [30] Other possible complications or side effects include: Pain Ear fullness Vertigo (generally temporary) Headache Dizziness Persistent tympanic membrane perforation Tinnitus Infection Syncopal episode Hearing loss Tongue numbness [30]"}

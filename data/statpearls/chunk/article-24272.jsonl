As the impulse projects from the premotor/motor cortex, glutamate stimulate the cholinergic-dependent indirect path of the striatum, which in turn activates GABA release and transmission. This GABA signaling path can go on to inhibit substantia nigra and the external segment of globus pallidus, allowing the subthalamic nucleus to stimulate the internal segment of the globus pallidus to release more GABA to inhibit the signaling from the thalamus. This causes decreased signaling activity from the motor cortex to the cerebellum and lower motor neurons within the spinal column, ultimately reducing motor activation.

[31] However, a study by Rabe et al revealed that for patients on oral glucocorticoid therapy for moderate-to-severe asthma or acute asthma exacerbations, adding dupilumab not only led to an overall reduction in the glucocorticoid use but also alleviation of symptoms associated with acute asthmatic episodes or exacerbations over 24 weeks. The only notable but transient adverse effect was reversible eosinophilia in about 14% of the patients. [35]"}

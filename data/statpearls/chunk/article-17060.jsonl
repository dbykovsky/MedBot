Physical and occupational therapy are useful ways of providing significant functional benefits. Rehabilitation aims to gradually promote a wide passive ROM and active motion to\u00a0avoid the development of shoulder dysfunction because of adhesive capsulitis. [26] Keeping the shoulder aligned is excessively important for rehabilitation as it reduces the mechanical traction on the scapula and shoulder region. Elevation of the scapula\u00a0minimizes the level of dysfunction of the trapezius muscle.

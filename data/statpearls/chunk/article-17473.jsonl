Despite the administration of intravenous diazepam, levetiracetam, and phenobarbital, the seizures remained uncontrolled. However, the seizures ceased just within 2 minutes of initiating intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE). Although a seizure recurrence occurred 30 minutes after the initial ILE treatment, these seizures were effectively managed through the re-administration of ILE. Therefore, ILE should be considered as a potential intervention for managing severe amoxapine overdose. [42] The prevailing mechanism of lipid emulsion treatment as adjunctive therapy in cases of drug toxicity is based on the\u00a0hypothesis of lipid shuttling. ILE administration establishes a substantial lipid compartment that efficiently absorbs highly lipid-soluble drugs such as amoxapine, aiding in their removal from the system.

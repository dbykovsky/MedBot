This article will utilize the Mediterranean diet in a broad sense, from the time of its initial rise pre-globalization to its use today. Before large-scale trade became available in the 1950s, people would eat what was available to them based on their geography, creating a seasonal variability for most. The Mediterranian diet is primarily a plant-based diet with the contributions from animal-based products being comprised of fish and poultry with a limited quantity of dairy products. While the modern version of the diet utilizes a higher proportion of red meat and processed foods, the diet's primary focus remains the same - plant-based with healthy fats.", "contents": "Mediterranean Diet -- Definition/Introduction.

Olive oil is a monounsaturated fat containing alpha-linoleic acid, an omega-3 essential fatty acid, which has been indicated to provide a cardioprotective benefit. [1] The reduction of risk factors [2] [3] [4] is believed to be the major contributor to the reduction in cardiovascular disease seen in those who adhere to the Mediterranian diet. Fish and other animals of the sea provide a great source of other omega fatty acids and are another predominant reason for the cardioprotective nature. [5] Another important element to acknowledge is the consumption of wine in moderation (specifically red), which has been suggested to provide multiple metabolic benefits. The most reproducible benefit appears to be in lipid metabolism, believed to be attributable to ethanol, but its microconstituents also may play important roles in hemostasis and inflammation.

The bacterial meningitis score was noted to have poor specificity in this study; therefore, the authors recommend not using this prediction tool in infants less than 60 days old. The\u00a0authors also noted that infants who did not have pleocytosis or abnormal Gram stain but were later proved to have bacterial meningitis either had peripheral leukocytosis or bandemia on presentation.\u00a0Notably, correcting the CSF leukocyte count for red blood cells (RBCs) decreased the sensitivity of pleocytosis for meningitis in this population. [38] Results from a recent study suggest that\u00a0for a traumatic LP subtracting one white blood cell (WBC) for every 400 RBCs in the CSF or using a complex calculation comparing the peripheral WBC to the CSF WBC counts may decrease the number of infants inaccurately diagnosed with meningitis.

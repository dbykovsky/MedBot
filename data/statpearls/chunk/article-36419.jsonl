[2] C fibers are the smallest, unmyelinated, have slow conduction velocities (0.2 to 2 m/s), and are the most abundant. These fibers typically transmit sustained slow sensations. A-delta fibers have a medium-sized cell body, are lightly myelinated, and have a moderate conduction velocity (5 to 30 m/s). They are responsible for quick sensations and prickling pain. A-beta fibers have a large cell body, are heavily myelinated, and have rapid conduction velocities (16 to 100 m/s). A-beta fibers are light-touch receptors that have low mechanical thresholds while A-delta and C fibers are nociceptors that respond to noxious mechanical, hot, or cold stimuli.

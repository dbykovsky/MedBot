Before the insertion of the central line, some traditional texts advocate bathing the patient from chin to ankle using chlorhexidine wash. This should be followed by preparing the skin for catheter placement by cleansing the insertion site thoroughly with chlorhexidine gluconate. Allow the area to dry fully before the provider proceeds with catheter insertion. [4] [1] [2]"}

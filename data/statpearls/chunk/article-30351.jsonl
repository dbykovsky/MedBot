Therefore, mercury can cause significant dysfunction of enzymes, membranes, transport mechanisms, and structural proteins. Inhibition of enzymes such as choline acetyltransferase and catechol O-methyltransferase can lead to acetylcholine deficiency, hypertension, and tachycardia. Mercury salts cause damage to the gastrointestinal tract mucosa and proximal renal tubules early after exposure. This damage is from the direct oxidative effects of mercuric ions. Inorganic salts have low lipid solubility, so they have poor penetration of the blood-brain barrier, but due to slow elimination, there is some accumulation. [5] Organic mercury, such as methylmercury, is lipophilic and distributes across all tissues, including the central nervous system. The organic mercury deposits in the CNS are thought to be converted to inorganic mercury, causing toxicity.

The prognosis of neonatal seizures depends on the underlying etiology. If EEG is normal the prognosis is excellent but if EEG has many abnormalities such neonates have a poor prognosis and may develop cerebral palsy and epilepsy. The presence of spikes on EEG has a 30% risk of developing future epilepsy. The mortality rate of neonatal seizures is reported to be as high as 20%.

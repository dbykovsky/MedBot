The most common cause of noninflammatory knee effusions of the knee, with synovial fluid\u00a0WBC count typically less than 2000 cells/mL, is osteoarthritis. Other causes include osteonecrosis, Charcot arthropathy, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, hypothyroidism, and acromegaly. Inflammatory arthritis, with synovial fluid WBCs greater than 2000 cells/mL,\u00a0may\u00a0arise from\u00a0infection, autoimmune disease, and crystal-induced arthritis. Aspiration of dark brown serosanguinous fluid should raise the possibility of pigmented villonodular synovitis."}

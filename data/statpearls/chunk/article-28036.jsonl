The decreased lumen size of the pulmonary vasculature causes increased right ventricular afterload. In turn, right ventricular dilation results in septal flattening and ultimately increased pulmonary artery systolic pressure."}

If a patient is found to have a mean PAP greater than 20 mmHg at rest and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) less than 15 mmHg and peripheral vascular resistance (PVR) greater than 3 Woods units on right heart catheterization, then pulmonary artery hypertension can be diagnosed. All other causes of elevated pulmonary artery pressure must be ruled out to diagnose idiopathic pulmonary artery hypertension. The severity of the disease is measurable by a patient's ability to complete a 6-minute walk test and is scaled according to the NYHA Functional Classification. Before initiating therapy, patients with IPAH should undergo vasoreactivity testing to determine if the patient would have a response to calcium channel blockers (CCB). The mainstay treatment for IPAH includes endothelin-blocking antagonists,\u00a0prostanoids, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors.", "contents": "Pulmonary Idiopathic Hypertension -- Pearls and Other Issues.

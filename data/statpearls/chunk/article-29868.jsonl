With the provided history of high-energy trauma to the foot and ankle and the above clinical findings, the primary differential diagnoses are fractures of other bones of the foot and ankle with or without injuries to the soft tissues of the foot and ankle such as ligaments, tendons, and neurovascular structures.

The relatively good prognosis of the talar head as compared to the neck and body is at least partially attributable to its good vascular supply. Regarding talar neck fractures, there is a strong positive correlation between the modified Hawkins-Canale fracture type and the risk of avascular necrosis. [19] [20] Additionally, studies have shown that the degree of fracture displacement, degree of comminution, extent of soft-tissue injury, and success of surgical reduction correlate with the development of osteonecrosis and other outcomes such as post-traumatic osteoarthrosis with rates of osteonecrosis in Type I, II, III, and IV fractures reported at 0 to 15%, 20 to 50%, 100%, and 100%, respectively. [21] [22] The Hawkins sign is a radiographic finding of a thin linear subcortical radiolucency appreciated on post-treatment images which indicate preserved blood flow to the talar body in the setting of talar neck fractures. Talar dome osteochondral defects which are stable and nondisplaced often heal well, while displaced unstable fragments may undergo osteonecrosis if not surgically repaired.

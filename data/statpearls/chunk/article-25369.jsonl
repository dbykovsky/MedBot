Vaccination is recommended in women who are breastfeeding along with children and other household contacts of pregnant women. Individuals\u00a0with life-threatening allergic reactions to components of the vaccine or those with significant immunosuppression are not candidates for vaccination. This includes patients with AIDS, leukemia, lymphoma, generalized malignancy, and those receiving treatment with chemotherapy, radiation, or corticosteroid therapy. Household contacts to individuals with severe immunosuppression should be vaccinated. AIDS or HIV patients who have signs of immunosuppression should not be vaccinated, but patients with HIV who do not have laboratory evidence of immunosuppression should be vaccinated. [23]"}

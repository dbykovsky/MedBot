Further details of the pelvic examination will be excluded from this activity; however, all components of the pelvic examination are essential for a comprehensive assessment of the patient. Evaluation of cervical motion tenderness occurs during the bimanual examination, performed by inserting the index finger and middle finger into the vagina until they are at the limit of the vaginal vault in the posterior fornix, which is posterior and caudad to the cervix. The examiner then uses their other hand to place pressure on the abdominal wall, over the suprapubic region. Each hand applies pressure towards the opposite hand, which allows for circumferential examination of the cervix for size, position, shape, mobility, and to assess if there is any present tenderness or palpable masses. \u00a0After cervical motion testing, it is crucial to continue onto the bimanual examination of the uterus for a complete assessment. This is accomplished by applying anterior pressure towards the patient\u2019s abdominal wall and assessing for the size, position, shape, tenderness, and mobility of the uterus itself. To finish the bimanual assessment examination of the adnexa is performed by placing the fingers to the side of the cervix, deep to the lateral fornix with pressure towards the anterior abdominal wall, and applying pressure with the abdominal hand toward the symphysis overlying the supporting structures including the ovaries. This will allow the examiner to distinguish the location of any acute tenderness, and note if there is any isolated cervical motion tenderness. This technique may vary in patients with different body mass index classes. [2]", "contents": "Chandelier Sign -- Clinical Significance.

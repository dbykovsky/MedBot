In cases of mycotic aneurysms, conservative treatment with antibiotic agents is a reasonable, although controversial, an alternative to direct surgical repair in some cases. For children with multiple aneurysms and those with preexisting cardiac disease and endocarditis, the risk of surgery may be unexceptionally high, even when weighed against the ongoing risk of a potentially devastating hemorrhage.

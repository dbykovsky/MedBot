[23]", "contents": "Anatomy, Shoulder and Upper Limb, Glenohumeral Joint -- Clinical Significance. Glenohumeral joint dislocation has an incidence of approximately 17 per 100,000 a year, with a peak incidence among males in the 21 to 30 year age range and females in the 61 to 80 year age range. Treatment typically involves analgesics and closed reduction, with some patients requiring subsequent surgical correction, especially those with concurrent soft tissue injuries resulting in recurrent shoulder dislocations. [22] The axillary nerve courses within\u00a0close\u00a0proximity of the glenohumeral joint and wrap around the neck of the humerus, and can incur damage during dislocation or subsequent attempts at reduction of the dislocated joint. Injury to the axillary nerves causes a loss of sensation over the lateral shoulder and paralysis of the deltoid. Hill-Sachs lesions (impaction fracture of the posterolateral humeral head against anteroinferior glenoid) and Bankart lesions (detachment of anteroinferior labrum with or without an avulsion fracture) can also occur following anterior dislocation. The recurrence rate of glenohumeral joint dislocation is approximately 50% on average; however, there is a significant increase in the risk of reoccurrence with a younger age of initial dislocation.

The pain is usually constant, worse at night. Incidence is approximately 3% of the general population, with some controversy over this number due to concerns of over-diagnosis of this disorder. It occurs more commonly in women aged 40 to 70 years of age. [24] Risk factors for adhesive capsulitis include diabetes mellitus, connective tissue diseases, thyroid disease, and heart disease. It has associations as an adverse effect of specific highly active antiretroviral therapies as well. [25] Management consists of physical and occupational therapy, medication (analgesics/NSAIDs), intraarticular steroid injection, and, in rare cases, surgery. Manipulation under general anesthesia may also be an option, which disrupts the scar tissue and adhesions within the joint. Over time, most people regain approximately 90% of their shoulder range of motion.", "contents": "Anatomy, Shoulder and Upper Limb, Glenohumeral Joint -- Clinical Significance.

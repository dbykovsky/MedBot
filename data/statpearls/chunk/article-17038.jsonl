The procedure is completed by aspiration of the uterus using a manual or electric vacuum and not by sharp curettage. The procedure is considered complete when the uterus is empty. Ultrasound can be used to confirm the completion of the procedure. Remove the tenaculum and the speculum. Check for the adequacy of the products of conception. If molar pregnancy is suspected, send the tissue to the pathologist for examination. Inform the patient of the complete procedure and the recovery process.\u00a0The procedure usually takes\u00a05 to 10 minutes, and antibiotics are given at the end of the procedure to avoid infection."}

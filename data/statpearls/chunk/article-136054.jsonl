[1] The typical onset of POI is in women less than 40 years of age and is diagnosed in the setting of amenorrhea lasting 4-6 months in combination with elevated follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and\u00a0decreased estradiol levels obtained one month apart. [2] [3] POI differs from menopause due to the remaining variability of ovarian function and primordial follicles, whereas menopause occurs when primordial follicles are exhausted, resulting in the cessation of menstruation altogether. [3] Other causes of secondary amenorrhea include\u00a0but are not limited to pregnancy, hypothyroidism, and genetic abnormalities. These conditions must be excluded before the diagnosis of POI. All women have the highest number of oocytes (approximately 6-7 million) present while still in utero at 20 weeks gestation. [2] [4] The dramatic decline in oocytes, irrespective of ovulation, continues down to approximately 300,000-400,000 oocytes at reproductive age. [2] Once menstruation begins, ovulation and constant oocyte attrition continue to reduce the ovarian reserve until menopause is reached. Throughout a woman\u2019s reproductive lifetime, only 400-500 oocytes are released with ovulation. [4] Normal menstruation and regular ovulation have significant impacts on female health overall.

Nutritional status and activity level must be evaluated to exclude the possibility of functional hypothalamic dysfunction causing menstrual irregularity.

Autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, or Addison disease can be present without evidence of POI. The polycystic ovarian syndrome may be the etiology of menstrual irregularity and anovulation leading to infertility.

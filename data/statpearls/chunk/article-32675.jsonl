TSH stimulation occurs when there is a low iodine level in the diet\u00a0by a negative feedback mechanism on pituitary thyrotrophs. TSH increases the size of the follicular cells (hypertrophy) and increases the number of follicular cells (hyperplasia). Thus under the influence of the TSH, the follicular cells become tall and columnar, demonstrating the heavy activity of the follicular cells and the follicles. The TSH also enhances the exocytosis, synthesis, and iodination of thyroglobulin. It also enhances endocytosis and intracellular breakdown of colloid. Thus the intraluminal colloid is greatly reduced, which manifests externally by the enlargement of the thyroid gland. Usually, enlargement of the thyroid gland is called goiter, which is a diseased state. But in this condition, the enlargement of the thyroid gland is because of the hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the parenchyma. Hence it is called parenchymatous\u00a0goiter.

This condition is known as colloid goiter.

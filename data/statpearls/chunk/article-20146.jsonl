The probe is then activated, typically using 2- or 3-minute freeze cycles interspersed with half-minute defrosting periods between applications; however, these timings may vary based on the manufacturer's guidelines. [24] Generally, it is essential to allow the tissues to warm up to above 0 \u00b0C before initiating the subsequent freeze cycle. Following the final freeze cycle, meticulous care is taken to ensure proper thawing, typically exceeding 120 seconds, before removing the cryoprobe to prevent tissue damage when detaching it from adhered frozen tissue. During the sheath's withdrawal, a small volume of local anesthetic can infiltrate the tissues."}

[21] [25] Other potential procedural complications include but are not limited to hypoalgesia, hyperalgesia, allodynia, and prolonged numbness greater than 3 months. With superficial procedures, damage to the skin with resulting alopecia, hyperpigmentation, and hypopigmentation can occur. This damage can be avoided by injecting a saline solution to elevate the skin surface. For intercostal nerves, there are reports of neuroma formation and pneumothorax. If a pneumothorax is caused by needle placement, the expanding gas cooling agent may worsen the pneumothorax. Patients experiencing pneumothorax should be administered 100% oxygen to de-nitrogenate the pneumothorax, mainly if nitrogen was used as the expansion gas.

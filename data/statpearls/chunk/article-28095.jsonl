Nitrite production will indicate that the causative bacteria is a urease-producing organism, possibly not E coli . While useful when positive, only about 25% of patients with a urinary tract infection will demonstrate nitrites on urinalysis. [50] Therefore, negative nitrites on a dipstick urinalysis do not rule out a UTI or acute pyelonephritis. [50] Proteinuria, bacteriuria, and microscopic hematuria may be present on urinalysis. Other causes, such as kidney stones, should also be considered if hematuria is present. In young women with acute pyelonephritis, up to about 40% are likely to demonstrate gross hematuria, which is much less common in men with the infection.\u00a0The finding of a single bacteria on a microscopic oil-immersion examination of unspun urine should indicate at least 100,000 colony-forming units (cfu)/mL for diagnosis."}

Most uncomplicated cases of acute pyelonephritis will be caused by E. coli, for which patients can generally be treated with oral cephalosporins, quinolones, or TMP-SMX, depending on community bacterial resistance patterns and specific culture results. Always obtain urine cultures before giving any antibiotics. Consider a catheterized urine specimen if the clean voided samples are contaminated."}

Always select the narrowest spectrum antimicrobial agent possible once the culture results are available. Switch to an acceptable oral agent as soon as practicable once the culture results are available, and the patient has clinically improved sufficiently. Do not use nitrofurantoin or other antimicrobials with inadequate tissue levels as a step-down antibiotic after parenteral therapy, even if culture reports indicate sensitivity. Consider using a single aminoglycoside dose empirically for sicker patients in addition to any other selected treatment. A single dose is well tolerated, has minimal transient nephrotoxicity, provides high renal tissue levels, reduces mortality, and provides better overall outcomes. Use the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio as an easy, available, early marker of sepsis. Ratios greater than 5 suggest sepsis.", "contents": "Acute Pyelonephritis -- Pearls and Other Issues.

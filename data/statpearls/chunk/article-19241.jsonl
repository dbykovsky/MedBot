[1] The pain can be local or regional, and can also be characterized by multiple trigger points. Trigger points are highly sensitive muscle\u00a0foci that are\u00a0painful to touch and refer pain\u00a0to the surrounding area. Specifically, in the cervical region, muscles commonly involved include the rhomboids, trapezius, levator scapulae, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus.

Patients may be more likely to develop trigger points if they have taut bands within the muscles; although, these taut bands are also common in asymptomatic individuals.

The most accepted theory states that there is an increase in acetylcholine abnormally, leading to\u00a0increased muscle tension and the formation of the taut bands that constrict blood vessels.

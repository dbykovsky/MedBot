This subjective screening method can determine if the individual is emmetropic, hyperopic, or myopic. This type of assessment can be helpful in a population-based setting to determine individuals needing further evaluation from an eye care professional for lens prescription. This type of screening does not provide information regarding the required correction or the severity of the refractive error and is thus not normally used in a routine clinical setting.", "contents": "Subjective Refraction Technique: Duochrome Test -- Technique or Treatment.

First, the patient sits 6 meters or 20 feet from the chart. A red or green filter is placed over one eye with the other occluded. The patient is then asked to read the letters on the eye chart out loud, starting from the top row and working their way down. The colored filter is then switched to green, and the patient rereads the chart with the other eye covered. This is repeated in the contralateral eye. The test results are compared to determine whether the patient is nearsighted, farsighted, or has no significant refractive error. If the patient reads more letters with the red filter, they are likely to be nearsighted (myopic), while if they read more letters with the green filter, they are likely to be farsighted (hyperopic).", "contents": "Subjective Refraction Technique: Duochrome Test -- Technique or Treatment.

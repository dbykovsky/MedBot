If an infant is in severe respiratory distress, there have been cases successively treated with selective intubation of the contralateral bronchus of patients affected by PIE. [42] [43] This allows the over-distended lung tissue to decompress. That lung\u00a0is prevented from being exposed to high positive oxygen pressures. Selective bronchial intubation of the left side bronchus is more complicated than the right side because the endotracheal tube needs to be inserted an additional 2 cm to 4 cm compared to the right. Upon intubation, the angle must be directed toward the bronchus of choice to increase the chance of intubating the correct bronchus. [43]"}

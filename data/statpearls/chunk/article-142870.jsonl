Hearing loss screening is generally considered a low-risk procedure.\u00a0Currently, there are\u00a0no randomized controlled trials or controlled observation trials\u00a0assessing the potential harms of hearing loss screening. [16] Potential\u00a0risks associated with\u00a0screening include unnecessary testing or treatment\u00a0due\u00a0to false-positive screening results. One potential harm of treatment could be the risk of exacerbating hearing loss\u00a0through overamplification when using hearing aids. However,\u00a0it is essential to note that this risk is rare due to the regulation of hearing aids as medical devices."}

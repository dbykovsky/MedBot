There is no universally accepted method of evaluating IAN and LN injury; however, the following is the grading system that characterizes the extent of nerve injury based on responses from the abovementioned tests. This grading system divides neurosensory deficits into three different levels: Level A (direction and two-point discrimination - A-alpha and A-beta fibers), Level B (contact detection - A-beta and A-delta fibers), and Level C (pain sensitivity - C fibers)."}

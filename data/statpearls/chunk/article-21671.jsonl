Hanrahan and Miller first performed splenectomy\u00a0on a patient with Felty syndrome, a 50-year-old woman, who had marked improvement in neutropenia and arthritis over\u00a05 months of follow-up. Subsequently, splenectomy was the main treatment option for patients with Felty syndrome. [39] [26] With the development of DMARDs and other biological agents, the surgical approach now has limited indications. It is reserved for patients with significant recurrent infections with neutropenia and those who failed to respond to all medical therapies, including DMARDs, biologic agents, and G-CSF. Other rare indications of splenectomy are severe anemia requiring multiple transfusions and severe hemorrhage due to thrombocytopenia, which is unresponsive to conventional treatment. [40] Neutropenia recurs postoperatively in a\u00a0quarter of cases. G-CSF has no role in this disorder beyond the transitory improvement in neutropenia when necessary. Patients with RA or\u00a0Felty syndrome can have anti-GCSF antibodies that can further compound treatment challenges. [3]"}

If splints are placed within the nose to assist with septal fracture reduction, these should be removed at the same visit. Patients should be advised that nasal bone fragments remain prone to shifting for up to 2 weeks after reduction and will not be considered fully healed for six weeks. For this reason, contact sports and games involving flying objects (playing catch, tennis, etc.) should be avoided for at least six weeks. Sleeping with the patient's head elevated and avoiding nose-blowing, heavy lifting, strenuous exercise, and bending over with the head below the heart will also help reduce post-procedure edema.", "contents": "Nasal Fracture Reduction -- Technique or Treatment -- Post Procedure.

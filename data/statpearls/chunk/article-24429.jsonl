Although never prospectively examined, the completeness of resection has been shown to impact overall and progression-free survival. [27] For patients with \u2265 90% resection of the tumor, the 5-year overall survival was 97% versus 76% for those <90%. [27] Based on the overall experience, most authorities in the field favor a maximal safe resection over biopsies.

Consequently, since many women engage in sexual activity for motives other than desire, the absence of desire may not always clearly indicate a sexual disorder. The replacement of \"desire\" with \"interest\" and consolidation of female sexual disorder into FSIAD in the DSM-5 was done to specify the duration and severity of symptoms required for diagnosing a female sexual disorder, to avoid classifying normal female functioning as pathological and to underscore the fact that sexual experiences in females are best described as being \"subjective and relational.\" [35] [36] [36] [37] [38]"}

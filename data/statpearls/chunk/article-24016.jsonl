These are but a few examples of how an interprofessional team can improve patient care in Landau-Kleffner syndrome. [Level 5]", "contents": "Landau-Kleffner Syndrome -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes. Children with a diagnosis of Landau-Kleffner syndrome require management with an interprofessional team. Therapeutic planning and interprofessional\u00a0communication among the various professional figures play an essential role in improving outcomes. The professionals involved are multiple and include\u00a0a pediatrician who has the task of care coordinator, a child neuropsychiatrist, and a neurophysiologist. Also, a speech therapist and a psychomotor therapist (in the case of younger children) will have to carry out specific habilitation and rehabilitation programs. The pharmacist should encourage medication compliance, check for drug interactions, and alert the prescriber to medications that may exacerbate the condition. Specialty-trained neuroscience nursing staff can assist in monitoring treatment, as well as counseling the patients and/or parents. Additionally, the social worker should ensure that the patient has adequate facilities in the home and access to support services. Strategies\u00a0aimed at strengthening communication functions require continuous calibration according to the patient's needs; this requires dynamic coordination for enhancing team performance. These are but a few examples of how an interprofessional team can improve patient care in Landau-Kleffner syndrome. [Level 5]"}

This makes the diagnosis and classification of AVP-d difficult. The water deprivation test or the indirect water deprivation test generally helps distinguish between different forms of this disease. This interpretation is complicated in partial AVP-D, AVP-R, or chronic primary polydipsia. Typically, patients with partial AVP-D or AVP-R retain some amount of response to water deprivation and desmopressin administration. [62] [44] In the case of chronic primary polydipsia, long-standing water diuresis blunts the renal medullary concentration gradient and causes down-regulation of the aquaporin-2 channels in the proximal tubule and the collecting duct due to suppressed endogenous AVP, thus creating a state mimicking AVP-R.

Closed abdomen technique: Thermal catheters and probes are placed in the same way, but the skin edges of the laparotomy are tightly sutured to allow perfusion in a closed circuit.\u00a0The abdominal wall is shaken manually by the surgeon during the infusion for uniform heat distribution. The volume of perfusate is greater in this technique to establish the circuit, and higher abdominal pressure is obtained during the perfusion, which facilitates tissue penetration of the drug. After infusion, the abdomen is reopened to remove the perfusate and the preparation of the anastomosis. This technique allows maintaining rapid attainment of hyperthermia because there is minimal heat loss."}

[25] It should be remembered that heavy and complex surgical procedures likely lead to increased toxicity of HIPEC through changes in pharmacokinetics, protein losses, hepatic and renal metabolic restrictions, and stress-related bone marrow suppression. [26] According to the literature, this increased toxicity is manifested by hematotoxicity and nephrotoxicity with respective frequencies of 5.6% and 1.7%. [25] Particular complications associated with the procedure are prolonged intestinal atony, increased fluid movement over the abdomen, delayed wound healing, and prolonged hospitalization.

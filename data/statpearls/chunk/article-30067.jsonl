There is an increased risk of rupture when the ascending aorta reaches 6 cm, and the descending aorta is at 7 cm. Therefore, elective surgery is advised for patients with a 5.5 cm ascending aorta and 6.5 cm descending aorta; the cut-off for ascending aneurysm is 5 cm in an asymptomatic patient with Marfan syndrome. [8] [5] Body size is also taken into account while planning surgery where an aortic size index (aortic diameter divided by body surface area) less than 27.5 cm/m necessitates surgery. [5] In TAA of the ascending aorta, an open surgical approach with aorta replacement is performed. [5] The extent of resection depends on the location of aneurysmal disease: some patients may be sufficiently treated with supracoronary ascending aorta replacement alone, while others may need more extensive surgery, which may include the aortic root or aortic arch. For patients with connective tissue disorders, bicuspid aortic valve, or strong family history of aortic dissection or rupture, replacing the sinus segment, ascending aorta, and proximal arch may be beneficial. For a bicuspid aortic valve, the valve can be replaced or repaired at the time of aortic surgery.

The part of the aorta in the thorax is called the thoracic aorta, and the part below it is called the abdominal aorta. An aneurysm of the thoracic aorta occurs when some part of the vessel is dilated compared to its original size. The ascending aortic aneurysm is the most common type and occurs at the junction between the heart and the aorta. The descending aortic aneurysm is the second most common type, and this occurs in the region of the thoracic aorta facing the legs. Most patients do not have any symptoms, but few patients can complain of pain in the chest or back, cough, or hoarseness. This is a serious condition as most patients do not have any initial symptoms and will develop severe chest pain that goes to the back when the layers of the aorta are tearing apart, which is called aortic dissection. Similar pain can also signify aortic rupture when the aortic aneurysm bursts open. These are the most likely complications of this condition. Male gender, smoking, history of uncontrolled blood pressure, and cholesterol levels are the main risk factors for the development of these aneurysms.", "contents": "Thoracic Aorta Aneurysm -- Deterrence and Patient Education.

If the size of the aneurysm is small, the physician will keep on monitoring it periodically.

Patients who smoke should quit, and those with secondhand smoke exposure should avoid those settings. A bigger size of the aneurysm, rapidly increasing size, or patients with symptoms will need surgery to fix the problem. Patients with a family history of sudden cardiac death and TAA should get themselves evaluated.

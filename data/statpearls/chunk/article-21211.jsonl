By the 20th week, the stratum germinativum begins proliferation and differentiation to form four more superficial strata of the epidermis: spinosum (spinous), granulosum , lucidum (clear, extra fifth layer seen only in the skin of palms and soles), and corneum (horny). Proliferation between weeks 12 to 14 forms epidermal ridges that protrude as troughs into the developing dermis beneath. Deep in the epidermis, lateral plate-derived mesenchymal cells proliferate to form dermis, filling the space between the epidermal ridges with dermal papillae. Neurovascular supply within the papillae is complete by the end of the first trimester. Between the ninth and 12th weeks, some of the stratum germinativum also differentiates into the first appearance of hair follicles. By the twelfth week, lanugo (fine, soft, unpigmented hair) is visible on the eyebrows, upper lip, and chin. By the seventeenth week, lanugo is substantial and aids in the adherence of the vernix caseosa to the skin. As melanocytes migrate in greater numbers within the epidermis, they also provide pigment to hair bulbs.

The theoretical paths of dorsal melanocytes, migrating laterally from the midline but stretched by the flexed fetus, is one potential basis for lines of normal cell development called Blaschko's lines.

Certain autosomal and X-linked inherited skin conditions affect keratinocytes and melanocytes, such as epidermal naevus, hypomelanosis of Ito, incontinent pigmenti, and also acquired conditions such as lichen striatus, linear morphea tend to follow a Blaschkoid distribution as a visible manifestation of genetic mosaicism. In women, some X-linked disorders follow a Blaschkoid distribution due to normal X-inactivation (lyonization), resulting in functional cutaneous mosaicism; one example is X-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia. Interestingly, the implicated gene in X-linked ichthyosis, which encodes steroid sulfatase, is known to \"escape\" X-inactivation and therefore does not follow Blaschko's lines. The genetic pathways for melanocyte migration and development are complex processes facilitated by several genes such as MITF,c-KIT, Snail/Slug, protooncogenes such as BRAF, and NRAS tumor suppressor genes such as CDKN2A, and endothelins like EDNRB. All of these genes carry implications in the pathogenesis of Malignant Melanoma. Out of these, mutations in BRAF and NRAS are present in nearly 65% and 20% of melanomas, respectively.

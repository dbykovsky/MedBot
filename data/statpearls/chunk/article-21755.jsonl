The vast majority of congenital fifth toe deformities resolve once childhood ambulation begins. Those that do not can generally be managed with nonoperative measures such as toe strapping and shoe modifications, as previously discussed. In the rare case where operative intervention is indicated, the Butler procedure and flexor tenotomies generally provide favorable outcomes and correction of overlapping toes and congenital curly toes, respectively.

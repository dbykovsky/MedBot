Low-income households repeatedly attributed economic burden as a barrier to initiating a healthier diet. [24] [25] [26] Low-income households purchase nutrient-dense foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and lean meats, less frequently due to the perceived high cost. [27] Implementing a healthy diet into a household, particularly one that includes children, presents added challenges. Calorie-dense foods such as processed meats, cereals, and pre-packaged, boxed, or ready-to-eat meals contain more fats and sugars but are usually less expensive than nutrient-dense foods. [24] Calorie-dense foods are frequently easier to prepare,\u00a0satisfy hunger more quickly, and may be more palatable to young children, adding to the purchase appeal. [24] Households where adolescents and adults work long hours, often at multiple jobs, have limited time to purchase food and prepare meals. [24] Residents of many lower-income communities are affected by food insecurity and frequently live in food deserts characterized by limited access to grocery stores or fresh food; the time required to access healthy foods, often using unreliable or limited transportation methods, adds to overall food costs. [25] [26] These factors pose significant challenges for patients to initiate a healthier diet and must be accounted for by healthcare providers when\u00a0recommending this treatment and intervention."}

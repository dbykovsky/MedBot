Significant changes to the operational plan are unnecessary on days with moderate temperatures and little chance of rain. The team may be required to operate in less-than-ideal conditions.

In a high-heat environment, team members should keep equipment weight low and wear clothing that allows for effective sweat evaporation. Cold environments may necessitate less adjustment in equipment and planning since additional layers of clothing to decrease heat loss may be sufficient. Team members should layer efficiently to avoid overheating and prevent decreased mobility. Each individual must feel comfortable with their layering system before starting the mission.

It is vital to keep in mind the patient's full history and physical exam, as these may suggest other etiologies besides blood loss. For example, if a patient has been taking a new beta-blocker, they may be having decreased blood pressure and renal hypoperfusion unrelated to blood loss. The physical exam must be used to assess the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and thighs to ensure there is no evidence of blood loss present. These signs could be as apparent as decreased breath sounds due to blood in the pleural space, or\u00a0increased abdominal distention or pain due to blood in the abdomen. Patients with some level of coagulopathy may also have hematomas that may develop along with the psoas, which may be difficult to diagnose on exam along. Any new pain in lower extremity flexion/extension should be the reason for concern. A CT of the abdomen/pelvis with contrast can be helpful in diagnosing a psoas hematoma, or retroperitoneal bleed.", "contents": "Shock Resuscitation -- Clinical Significance. As previously stated, a common sign of impending shock can be a decrease in pulse pressure, an increased heart rate, or a slight increase in breathing. Most important of all, the clinical evidence of decreased urine output can indicate impending shock as kidneys become slightly hypoperfused. A decrease of urine output below 30 ccs/hr, or more exactly less than 0.5 ccs/kg/hr, suggests renal hypoperfusion and could be the first sign of stage 1 shock. Of course, there are other reasons which could be causing renal hypoperfusion.

[6] The PROMTT study was a prospective, multicenter observational cohort in which a varying ratio of blood products (1:1:1 vs. 1:1:2)\u00a0was\u00a0administered to patients in shock to determine any changes in 6-hour survival rates. It\u00a0was found that 1:2 ratios or higher had a higher likelihood of dying in the first 6 hours, and that earlier transfusion of blood products and earlier use of FFP showed to have decreased 24 hours and 30-day mortality. In a similar vein, the PROPPR trial was a randomized clinical trial where 1:1:1 and 1:1:2 ratios for transfusions were compared specifically for any difference in mortality at 24 hours and then again at 30 days. While there was no significant difference in mortality rates, the 1:1:1 group did experience lower rates of death from exsanguination at 24 hours as well as fewer instances of\u00a0ARDS, MODS, sepsis, infection, or VTE.

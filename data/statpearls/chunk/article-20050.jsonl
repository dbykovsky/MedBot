Although the term cosmeceutical is steeped in dermatology literature and dominates academic discussions, symposia, and lectures around the world,\u00a0it is strangely interesting that almost four decades after coining the term, this category of skincare products is still not formally recognized by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US-FDA) or the European Union.\u00a0This disparity stems from the differentiation between 'cosmetics' and 'drugs' by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) based on their intended use and ability to affect the structure and function of the cutis. Both in the United States and the European Union, a drug is defined as \"an article intended for the use in the diagnosis, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease or intended to affect the structure or any function of\u00a0the body.\" [3] In contrast, the FD&C Act of 1938 defines cosmetics as \"articles intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on, introduced into, or otherwise applied to the human body or any part thereof for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance\" without affecting structure or function. [3] In India, a well-defined Drugs and Cosmetics Act (1940) operates the regulations of cosmetics under the authority of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO).

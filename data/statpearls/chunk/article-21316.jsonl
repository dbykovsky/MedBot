For patients with EPP, the likelihood of having an affected child will depend on whether the other parent carries the hypomorphic IVS3-48T/C allele, which is more common in some populations than others. Testing the other parent can determine this likelihood. If the other parent's\u00a0FECH\u00a0genes are both normal, half the children will inherit the severe\u00a0FECH\u00a0mutation (which may be passed on to future generations); however, they will not have EPP because they also inherited one normal\u00a0FECH\u00a0allele.", "contents": "Erythropoietic Protoporphyria -- Deterrence and Patient Education.

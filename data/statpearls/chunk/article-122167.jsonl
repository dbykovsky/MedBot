Transmission of X-rays means the X-rays photons have passed through the patient and hit the photosensitive detector (historically called a \u201ccassette\u201d) on the patient's other side. This digital detector detects the X-ray photons that have hit it and converts it into an electrical signal used to represent different pixels, which are then put together to produce the conventional radiograph (colloquially called an \u201cX-ray\u201d). This is done by scintillators (phosphors) that emit light in the digital detector when exposed to radiation. The scintillator's emitted light is then detected by a light detector, which converted the information into a pixellated digital image. Digital detectors exposed to a small amount of radiation by manipulating the mAs and kVp may result in \"noisy\" images that degrade image quality. On the other end of the spectrum, digital detectors exposed to a large amount of radiation may not necessarily affect image quality but do expose the patient to unnecessary radiation. In comparison, analog radiographs (less commonly used) use film to capture, display, and store radiographic images. An analog radiograph film is made from a thin emulsion with support from Mylar (thick polyester). The emulsion contains silver halide grains, which, when exposed to radiation, become sensitized. Once the film is passed through a developer and fixer solution, the film may be hung on a lightbox for viewing. [10] [11]"}

The imaging technologist and the interpreting radiologist's technical evaluation should be done before a report is issued associated with the radiograph. It is important for imaging technologists and radiologists to keep in good communication with each other as well, as it promotes a culture of learning in the radiology department and allows for a collaborative enhancement between the two roles, which can heighten awareness of technical factors that should be evaluated on every radiograph.

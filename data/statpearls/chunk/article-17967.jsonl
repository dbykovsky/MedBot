[15] Contraindications to percutaneous closure are small hemodynamically insignificant ASDs, ostium primum defects, sinus venosus defects and coronary sinus defects, and secundum defects with advanced pulmonary hypertension. [15] When atrial septal defects are closed percutaneously, patients\u00a0require antiplatelet therapy for the subsequent 6 months. [15] Women with large ASDs and\u00a0Eisenmenger Syndrome should avoid pregnancy due to the risks of aggravating pulmonary artery hypertension that might be present and the increased occurrence of dysrhythmias. [14] Surgical closure of atrial septal defects requires the placement of a patch over the lesion through an incision in the right atrium."}

If PCI is unavailable, fibrinolytics can be administered up to 12 hours from symptom onset. [14] The authors do not recommend using opioid pain medication to treat chest pain suspicious for ACS unless the decision to perform emergent reperfusion is already made and maximal medical therapy has already been initiated, as it may mask, and therefore, delay definitive treatment which is required for ischemia refractory of maximal medical management.

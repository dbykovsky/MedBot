Documentation exists of pneumonitis, hepatitis, and organ rejection in transplant patients, with death reported in patients with encephalitis and meningoencephalitis. [18] Similarly, in Japan a 2003 to 2004 survey of patients with exanthema subitum-associated encephalitis had an unusually poor prognosis, [19] with reported fatalities in two children with encephalopathy secondary to HHV-6 infection. The children were discovered to have a genetic mitochondrial disorder. [20]"}

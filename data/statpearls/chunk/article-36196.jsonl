The course of the ureter can be more tortuous and the point of insertion higher in the kidney, impairing the flow of urine through the urinary tract.

Hydronephrosis can be diagnosed with ultrasound imaging; however, vesicoureteric reflux requires further investigation. The gold standard is voiding cystourethrography (VCUG).

With the prevalence of obesity being higher among non-Hispanic black adults than among other races, it is crucial to ensure that recommended behavioral therapies work as effectively in these groups. At least one randomized control trial has shown that rates of achieving clinically significant weight loss were higher among non-Hispanic black adults who received ACT in addition to traditional behavioral therapy compared with behavioral therapy alone. [18] ACT is based on recognizing human tendencies to cope with unpleasant situations by avoiding and approaching them through action. The desired outcome is to tolerate internal cues that trigger cravings or negative health behaviors, allowing for psychological flexibility. This method has promise in producing long-term weight loss outcomes. [19]", "contents": "Behavioral Approaches to Obesity Treatment -- Other Issues.

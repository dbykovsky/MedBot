The ability to make a standardized patient (SP) look pale with makeup to simulate internal blood loss can provide valuable visual information to a learner just as ecchymoses and abrasions applied to a lower extremity following to story of a vehicular crash can.", "contents": "Moulage in Medical Simulation  -- Function.

Moulage can also include staging an environment to provide even more immersion into a clinical setting. For example, blood pooling on a floor or bed can represent hypovolemia. Personal articles such as photographs in a simulated clinical room can add emotion to a breaking bad news scenario. Clothing can also be modified to demonstrate tears, dirt, etc. for trauma scenarios. Moulage can be effective on both SPs and mannequins. There are some products, such as grease makeup, that stain the silicone-based skin on mannequins. Therefore due diligence should be made to investigate those products before application. The simulation community is growing, and tips and tricks are abundantly published on the internet and within listservs. Lastly, always inquire whether an SP has allergies before applying products, especially those with adhesives and latex.", "contents": "Moulage in Medical Simulation  -- Function.

At least one study examined the effectiveness of moulage applied by nonprofessionals (i.e., introductory training versus makeup artists) with learners reporting added realism to their immersive experience no matter who applied the moulage. [3] Simulation conferences also offer workshops and courses. Typical materials include wax, latex, petroleum jelly, tissue paper, stage blood, charcoal powder, and eyeshadow, along with common household cooking ingredients such as corn syrup, cocoa powder, and food coloring. For example, a burn can be made with tissue paper and petroleum jelly, while corn syrup and food coloring can be applied near the mouth of an SP to simulate blood. Cocoa powder and charcoal powder can be a stand-in for dirt. [4] Moulage can also incorporate constructing prosthetics and attaching them to an individual instead of using makeup directly on the skin. While moulage can be time-intensive with the added cost of materials, this is an invaluable option to incorporate into simulation scenarios.", "contents": "Moulage in Medical Simulation  -- Issues of Concern.

Peripheral and Central Structures of the Auditory System) [26] Tumor enlargement\u00a0can put pressure on the surrounding structures, notably cranial nerves VIII, VII, and IX, the cerebellum, and the brainstem. Hearing loss is usually the initial symptom. As the tumor grows, other nerve deficits may also manifest, with some ipsilateral to the tumor. Examples are the following: [27] Tinnitus Vertigo Nystagmus Facial drooping Decreased corneal reflex Hoarseness Dysphagia Ataxia Dysarthria"}

The tibial-inlay techniques used for ORIF of bony avulsions and to secure\u00a0bone-to-bone tibial attachment with an anchor or screw. Its disadvantage is having a screw fixation within 20 mm of the popliteal artery. The technique can be\u00a0performed by a posteromedial approach between semitendinosus and medial gastrocnemius, but multiple all-arthroscopic techniques have been described [31] .\u00a0Tibial inlay techniques can also be utilized for double-bundle reconstruction using a bone plug to attach the graft to the tibial origin and the tendon is split in two representing the two PCL bundles."}

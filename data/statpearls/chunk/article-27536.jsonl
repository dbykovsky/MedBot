Postoperative pain control is a complex endeavor requiring interprofessional participation that begins in the preoperative setting and continues into patient recovery. A thorough preoperative patient assessment by the primary care provider, nurse, surgeon, and anesthesiologist can aid in identifying patient risk factors and comorbidities that may influence the severity of their postoperative recovery period and allow for developing an individually tailored pain regimen. A multimodal, interprofessional approach to pain control allows for safer, more efficacious pain relief for the patient postoperatively as opposed to primary reliance on opioid therapy. In the immediate postoperative period, nurses play an essential role in monitoring the severity of the patient\u2019s pain level and communicating the need for further intervention to other team members as necessary."}

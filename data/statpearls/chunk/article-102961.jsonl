Muscle energy is an active and direct technique that engages the patient\u2019s restrictive barrier. The patient contracts the muscle of interest while the physician introduces a counterforce.

There are nerve reflexes that regulate the posturo-dynamic system: the neuromuscular unit that first controls this system is the reflex arc. This concept works according to a closed circuit: the nerve impulse originating from the muscle penetrates the posterior horn of the gray matter of the spinal cord and transmits the impulse, through a synaptic contact, to the motor neurons of the anterior horn, causing a contractile response.

The superfield lens provides\u00a0wide-field imaging up to the periphery. It is beneficial in these conditions. In many patients, the pupil is non-dilating. Visualization of internal structures is difficult in a constricted pupil. The super pupil XL lens can be used in a\u00a0small pupil. It is essential to document the ocular signs. The clinical photographs should be clicked and stored. The digital 1.0x lens has a distinct curvature. Its special antireflective coating decreases the slit lamp glare and distortion. Its high-resolution image has greater clarity compared to other lenses. Thus it is a perfect lens for slit lamp photography and documentation."}

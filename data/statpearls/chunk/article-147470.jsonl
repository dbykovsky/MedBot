Urine cobalt levels are most commonly used for occupational monitoring. Normal serum cobalt is reported to be 0.1 to 1.2 mcg/L. The normal reference range for urine cobalt is 0.1 to 2.2 mcg/L. [62] [63] Because of the normal variation of elimination kinetics, it is important to determine the dose and length of time of exposure to properly interpret urine levels. Whole blood levels are thought to most accurately reflect the whole body burden.

Mitigating the effects of phantosmia can be difficult due to the lack of treatment options. The debilitating effects of phantosmia may be mitigated by addressing underlying etiologies and employing patient\u00a0education. This is supported by many cases of phantosmia secondary to migraines, seizures, or schizophrenia, resolving with the treatment of the underlying etiology."}

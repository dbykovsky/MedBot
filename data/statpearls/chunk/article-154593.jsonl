This condition typically occurs as a result of both allergic and traumatic responses to the wearing of contact lenses. Patients with GPC commonly present with symptoms such as ocular itching, decreased tolerance to contact lens wear, blurred vision, and excessive mucous production in the eyes. Complications associated with GPC can arise due to infrequent replacement of contact lenses, prolonged wearing of lenses, poor hygiene practices related to lens care, and a history of atopic conditions. The development of GPC is believed to result from mechanical trauma to the superior tarsal conjunctiva, coupled with an immunologic response by the conjunctiva to deposits on the anterior surface of the contact lens. These factors can trigger an inflammatory reaction leading to the formation of giant papillae. It is essential to recognize the association between GPC and contact lens wear and the potential underlying allergic and immunologic mechanisms involved.

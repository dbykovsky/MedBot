The condition can be benign or malignant, and hence an interprofessional approach is necessary to make a prompt diagnosis. Healthcare workers in primary care, including nurse practitioners, should always refer the patient to a dermatologist if unsure about the rash. The overall prognosis for patients with the malignant form of acanthosis nigricans is poor, with an average survival of fewer than 24 months.

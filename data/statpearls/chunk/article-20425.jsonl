[5] As a colloid, dextran osmotically expands plasma volume by restoring blood plasma lost through severe hemorrhage. Its volume of distribution is throughout the blood volume of the body. By expanding blood volume, dextran increases cardiac output and blood flow so that red blood cells can effectively circulate to end-organ microvasculature.

It is relatively contraindicated in patients with untreated bleeding disorders, including platelet dysfunction, because of increased bleeding risk. Caution should be exercised in patients with heart failure, as rapid administration may prove dangerous due to the plasma volume expansion effects, potentially leading to circulatory overload and acute decompensation. However, even slower but continued administration may pose some risk as it may reduce plasma protein levels, which can reduce oncotic pressure and worsen edema. If volume overload occurs during dextran administration, an osmotic diuretic is the recommended intervention. For patients with underlying renal disease, failure to clear dextran can lead to worsening of renal function.

Canon of Medicine authored by Avicenna is one of the most prominent medical manuscripts which also touches on gastrointestinal\u00a0disorders such as flatulence. From Avicenna's viewpoint, bloating is the result of imperfect digestion caused by 4 eating habits including: consumption of beans/peas, consumption of fruits, consumption of smoked salted foods, and overeating [2] .

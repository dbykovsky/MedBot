[20] Early and careful removal of all the parts of the catheter is important to prevent further complications.\u00a0 Another complication that can occur due to using central lines for an extended period is venous thrombosis. Patients generally present with ipsilateral limb edema, erythema, and paresthesia. [9] Venous thrombosis can also lead to the development of superior vena cava syndrome. Its incidence is around 1 in 1000 cases. [23] Subclavian lines have the lowest while femoral lines have the highest rate of thrombosis. [23] Venous stenosis is also the result of using a central line for a longer period. Most of the patients who develop venous stenosis are asymptomatic but if they become symptomatic then they can be treated with stenting. [22]"}

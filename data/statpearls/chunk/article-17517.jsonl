Diuretic therapy can lead to volume depletion in patients with localized edema due to venous or lymphatic obstruction or malignant ascites and, therefore, may not be helpful. However, in severely generalized edematous states, such as congestive heart failure, initial therapy is recommended to begin with a loop diuretic, such as\u00a0furosemide or bumetanide. [29] Treatment for anasarca due to cirrhosis can begin with spironolactone alone or a combination of\u00a0spironolactone\u00a0and a loop diuretic like furosemide. The recommended initial dosage of spironolactone is 100 mg/day, titrating up to 400 mg/day according to patient response; furosemide can be initiated at a dosage between 20 and 40 mg/day.

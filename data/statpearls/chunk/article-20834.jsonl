As dead skin cells slough off and move out of the ear canal, they combine with the oily secretions of sebaceous glands and the modified sweat of the ceruminous glands. The combination of these substances makes up cerumen, consisting primarily of dead keratin cells. [1] Cerumen serves as a protective barrier to trap foreign particles.

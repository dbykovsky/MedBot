They are synovial joints as a fibrous capsule encompasses the bone and articulating cartilage and is continuous with the periosteum. The joint also contains synovial fluid which is kept in place by an inner membrane. The function of these joints is to allow for flexion and extension of the spine while limiting rotation and preventing the vertebrae from slipping over each other. The sensory nerve of these joints is the medial branch of the dorsal spinal ramus. Facet joint disease, also known as facet syndrome, is a condition in which these joints become a source of pain. Facet joint mediated pain is a common source of disability amongst our population with significant economic impact. Chronic low back pain often results from facet joint disease, with a prevalence of 15 to 41%. [1]", "contents": "Facet Joint Disease -- Introduction.

Other causes of facet joint disease include trauma secondary to injury or sporting activities. Inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis may also contribute due to the inflammation of the synovium. Subluxation of the facet joints due to spondylolisthesis can also contribute to the development of facet joint disease. Those with facet joint disease show signs of cartilage erosion and inflammation, which can lead to pain. The body will also undergo several physical changes in response to this process. Ligaments, such as the ligamentum flavum, can become thickened and hypertrophic. New bone formation around the joint can occur with the development of osteophytes or \u201cbone spurs.\u201d There can also be an increase in the subchondral bone volume with hypomineralization.

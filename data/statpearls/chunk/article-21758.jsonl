Although it has uses in other fields of medicine, its primary use is in the field of hematology\u00a0and oncology\u00a0to reduce the duration of neutropenia in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy or patients with myelosuppression. Clinicians should prioritize monitoring patients\u00a0as monitoring is essential to track the response\u00a0and minimize complications.

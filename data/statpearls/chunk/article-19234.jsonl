Outcomes of cervical epidural injections typically depend on the mechanism of injury and the degree of pathology. There is a recurrence of symptoms in up to one-third of patients with compressive cervical radiculopathy following initial treatment. [1] Repeated injections over one year may have a synergistic effect on pain relief. Cervical epidural corticosteroid injections are significant for short-term pain relief. However, limited studies are comparing the effectiveness of various techniques. [30] Intralaminar approached injections\u00a0are more extensively studied in comparison to cervical transforaminal epidural injections. There is good evidence for cervical epidural injections for pain secondary to\u00a0cervical disc herniation, central spinal stenosis, and postsurgery syndrome. There is weaker evidence for the transforaminal approach and a\u00a0higher side effect profile. [31] There are a reduced number of well-designed randomized, controlled trials.\u00a0For\u00a0short-term pain relief (less than six weeks), a cervical epidural,\u00a0there is moderate evidence in its use but sparse long-term data. Similar evidence studies have been done\u00a0for both interlaminar and transformational injections. [32] One study\u00a0showed significant pain relief with corticosteroid epidurals when compared to a local anesthetic injection."}

The original PVSG trial showed that, despite greater longevity, patients treated with phlebotomy alone were at a greater risk of developing thrombosis during the first three years of therapy. This seemed to suggest a potential benefit to concurrently using antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents. Initial trials using higher doses of aspirin or dipyridamole showed unsatisfactory gastrointestinal\u00a0hemorrhage. However, subsequent studies\u00a0found that lower doses of aspirin could be safely used.

Commonly involved drugs include HIV protease inhibitors, antimycotics such as itraconazole and ketoconazole, cyclosporine, which can lead to graft rejections, calcium channel blockers such as verapamil, nifedipine, and diltiazem, sulfonylureas, oral contraceptives, and warfarin. Upon initiating rifampin, it usually takes approximately a week for the induction of drug-metabolizing enzymes to generate clinically significant interactions. Moreover, this effect persists for nearly 2 weeks after discontinuing rifampin. [38] The\u00a0drugs that can be significantly impacted if administered with rifampin include: Rifampin induces CYP3A4, substantially reducing\u00a0oxycodone, morphine, and methadone concentrations, potentially leading to opioid withdrawal. Hence, dosage adjustments become necessary. [39] [40] Concomitant usage of rifampin diminishes the plasma concentration of simvastatin due to the induction of CYP3A4. [41]"}

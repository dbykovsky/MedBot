Although there are no significant medical complications associated with Frey syndrome, it can significantly\u00a0reduce the patient's quality of life. Subjective perception and discomfort associated with Frey syndrome can persist beyond five years after surgery. [85] Quality of life questionnaires showed a statistically significant correlation between decreased social functioning, economic difficulties, speech defects, reduced sexuality, poor oral nutrition, and Frey syndrome.

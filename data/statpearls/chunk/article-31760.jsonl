This research was stimulated by evidence showing that tactical medicine environment and care differed substantially from typical prehospital medicine, that 90% of all combat deaths occur prior to reaching a treatment facility, and that extremity hemorrhage was a major cause of combat death. This places the wounded combatant, unit medic, or fellow soldier in the primary role of life-sustaining care. Early and effective use of the tourniquet substantially improved outcomes through evaluation from 1993 to 1996; because of this, TCCC was formed and implemented, initially in small unit group tactics and eventually becoming the basis for trauma care in the battlefield setting. Currently, TCC is a DoD course that is offered by National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians (NAEMT) in either a 2-day course for medical personnel or a 1-day course for all combatants. NAEMT also offers Tactical Emergency Casualty Care (TECC) for civilian emergency medical services (EMS). [1]", "contents": "EMS Tactical Combat Casualty Care -- Introduction.

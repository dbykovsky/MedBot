Abruptly stopping medications, especially oral steroids, can lead to a recurrence of skin lesions and adrenal insufficiency. Patients must understand the need for a gradual reduction in medication dosage. In addition, if concurrent medical conditions are present, such as malignancies or gastrointestinal diseases, effectively diagnosing and managing these conditions\u00a0are essential for overall health and may impact the prognosis of IgA pemphigus."}

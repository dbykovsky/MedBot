Fixed Deformities Limited Intercarpal Fusion Patients with a limited wrist fusion can experience some pain relief while maintaining a functional range of motion. A total wrist fusion is not always necessary, so a limited wrist arthrodesis is a viable option. [22] Triscaphe Arthrodesis In localized degenerative arthritis, limited wrist arthrodesis of the joints between the scaphoid, trapezium, and trapezoid is recommended. The wrist retains about 80% of its flexion-extension and 66 percent of its radial and ulnar deviation after the three-bone unit is fused. [23] Another comparison study showed that\u00a0the dorsal capsulodesis group performed better (p 0.05) than the triscaphe arthrodesis group in grip strength, range of motion, practical outcome (Krimmer Score), length of the procedure, and hospitalization.

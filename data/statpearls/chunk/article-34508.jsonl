When a microorganism manages to overcome the host's defenses, it can cause harm to the body. The infection process is not yet fully understood, and it is influenced by factors such as the microorganism's pathogenicity and virulence, as well as the host's immunocompetence. On the other hand, not all host-pathogen interactions lead to disease, and it's essential to establish new terms and definitions to understand these interactions better. While microbiological evaluation alone is usually insufficient for diagnosing infections, a thorough patient assessment is critical. Additionally, different wounds can support diverse communities of microorganisms, and the acquisition of microbial species can result in contamination, colonization, or infection.

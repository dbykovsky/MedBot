The most reliable indicators of a patient's prognosis suffering from primary biliary cholangitis are the rise in serum bilirubin level and the Mayo risk score. On the basis of bilirubin levels the prognosis can be determined as follows: Bilirubin constantly above 2 - mean survival is 4 years Bilirubin constantly above 6 -\u00a0mean survival is 2 years Bilirubin constantly above 10 -\u00a0mean survival is 1.4 years In a study, it was determined that fatigue levels may also be a prognostic indicator of primary biliary cholangitis.

Patients should be educated not to purchase compounded products, as the FDA does not assess compounded versions for safety, efficacy, or quality.\u00a0Additionally, adverse effects are associated with cases where compounders salts of Semaglutide, such as Semaglutide sodium and Semaglutide acetate.\u00a0In\u00a03 recent cases, patients experienced adverse effects due to the incorrect administration of Semaglutide for weight loss. These incidents occurred after obtaining the medication from compounding pharmacies and an aesthetic spa. In\u00a02 instances, patients self-administered doses\u00a010 times higher than prescribed. All individuals reported experiencing significant symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and prolonged abdominal discomfort lasting several days. Additionally, one patient mentioned experiencing a headache, reduced appetite, weakness, and fatigue. Notably, one patient sought medical evaluation and showed improvement after receiving antiemetic and\u00a0intravenous fluids. Another patient, who obtained their medication from a compounding pharmacy, reported receiving a vial with syringes for self-administration but noted a lack of counseling on proper administration by the pharmacist. Compounded Semaglutide lacks the safety features in prefilled pens, potentially leading to dangerous overdoses. Using incorrect syringes adds to dosing variability and patient confusion.\u00a0Stringent labeling, dispensing, and counseling practices are crucial to mitigate these risks. Healthcare professionals should actively advocate for the proper use and dispensing of compounded Semaglutide. These measures hold the potential to significantly decrease the risk of severe adverse events and unnecessary hospitalizations due to dosing errors. [43]"}

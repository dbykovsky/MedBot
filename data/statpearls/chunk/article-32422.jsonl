Dorsal dislocations are more common, and occur secondary to hyperextension of the joint, most commonly from a fall on an outstretched hand.

The presence of the volar plate and strong lateral ligaments help\u00a0to explain why the majority of MCP joint dislocation occurs dorsally, as opposed to lateral or volar dislocation. Simple dislocations are those that are capable of being reduced by closed reduction. Complex dislocations, however, are typically not amenable to closed reduction.

For dorsal dislocations, the joint will appear somewhat hyperextended due to damage to both the palmar plate and joint capsule.

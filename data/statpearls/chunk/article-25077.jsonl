At higher concentrations, methohexital directly stimulates and activates the receptor. Barbiturates bind to the GABA A receptor and increase the open duration of the GABA A receptor without having any effect on channel opening frequency or conductance. Specifically, the downstream effect is on the chloride channel, causing it to stay open longer, causing influx. This action causes inhibitory pathways to activate in the brain and causes decreased neuronal excitability, thus inducing anesthesia/sedation. [5] Research has shown the highest concentration of methohexital in the hypothalamus, globus pallidus, and the substantia nigra. Once the GABA receptor is activated, increased chloride influx causes increases the negative charge on the inside of the membrane resulting in hyperpolarization and thus post-synaptic neuron inhibition.

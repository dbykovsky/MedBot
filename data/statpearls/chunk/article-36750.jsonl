[2] The corticospinal tracts then come together to form bundles, which travel through the internal capsule and cerebral peduncles. The bundles then travel down to the brainstem. [3] As the tract reaches the pons, the bundles take on a more compact structure and continue to condense as they descend. As a result, the neural structure of the corticospinal tract takes up more surface area in the upper pons than in the lower pons. [4] As the corticospinal tract continues to travel down into the medulla, 75\u00a0to 90% of the fibers will decussate to the contralateral side via the pyramidal decussation. [5] [3] The 5\u00a0to 15% of fibers that do not decussate within the pyramidal decussation make up the anterior corticospinal tract. This tract extends into the spinal cord, but only travels down to the levels of the lower thoracic cord. Various collaterals also exist for the corticospinal tract, with the aberrant pyramidal tract being the most representative. The aberrant pyramidal tract separates from the corticospinal tract within the midbrain and pons, then descends through the medial lemniscus.

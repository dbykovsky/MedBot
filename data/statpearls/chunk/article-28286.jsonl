The deoxygenated blood that arrives at the lungs contains hemoglobin with ferrous heme (Fe) with an affinity for oxygen. Upon arrival to the deoxygenated tissues, the decreased partial pressure of oxygen and low pH cause the heme to lose its affinity for the oxygen, delivering it to the tissue.

Most of the carbon dioxide will travel back to the lungs in the form of bicarbonate and be exhaled. [2]", "contents": "Histology, Red Blood Cell -- Function.

A typical erythrocyte will be circular in shape with a central area of pallor due to its biconcave shape. When evaluating the erythrocyte size, it can be described as macrocytic (large), microcytic (small) or normocytic. Anisocytosis means a variation in size amongst the red blood cells on a single slide. Color can undergo evaluation as hyperchromic or hypochromic. Anisochromia refers to a variance in the amount of central pallor amongst a group of RBCs. Polychromasia is a variety of color amongst the erythrocytes. Red blood cell agglutination means that the cells are clumped together in a cluster and rouleaux refers to the erythrocytes arranged in a linear formation. The shape can vary drastically with many different forms of red blood cells described in the literature. Acanthocyte or a spur cell has irregular projections of varying size and distance from either other. A bite cell has a semi-circular indentation as if someone took a bite from it. Echinocytes are erythrocytes with uniform projections all equidistant apart. Schistocyte is a term that refers to an RBC fragment that has been sheared. A sickle cell is an RBC with a crescentic shape. Spherocytes are erythrocytes that have no central pallor and are uniformly red throughout. Stomatocytes have a linear central clearing rather than a circular one. Target cells have a red center with a central clearing. Teardrop cells taper on one end.

In an ideal situation, the erythrocyte exists as a biconcave disc. When exposed to certain chemicals or compounds, the cell morphs in response. It has been proposed that this happens under two conditions: when the environment changes the phospholipid bilayer of the erythrocyte or when exposed to oxidants in the environment. For example, when red blood cells are depleted of their energy source, ATP, or when there is increased intracellular calcium, the cell develops an echinocyte shape. Also, when an erythrocyte swells with water, it becomes a stomatocyte. These changes occur because of how these situations manipulate the lipid bilayer membrane. Additionally, the red blood cell has an efficient way to convert hydrogen peroxide to water to prevent its protein degradation and lipid peroxidation abilities. In certain inherited conditions, the red blood cell is void of the enzymes needed to carry out this function and therefore suffers from the oxidative stress of its environment. This situation could lead to the formation of Heinz bodies, or denatured hemoglobin, such as in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. Other oxidative changes to the red blood cell occur in blood bank storage.

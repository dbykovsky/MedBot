In cases of childhood cancer, cardiac cause of death in anthracycline toxicity remains rare at less than 0.5% incidence during anthracycline chemotherapy; this includes patients exposed to high doses when anthracycline toxicity on cardiac imaging is noted, and patients also appear to require fewer cardiac devices. [49] To this end, cardiac cause of death has an incidence of 0.14% following 30-year survivorship for childhood cancer, even in cases of high-dose anthracycline and impaired cardiac function. [50]"}

The exact etiology of these effusions is unclear. Anthracycline toxicity can predispose to supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. The incidence of these tachyarrhythmias is 10% to 15% in subclinical anthracycline toxicity\u00a0and is similar to other forms of dilated cardiomyopathy when reductions in LVEF are significant.

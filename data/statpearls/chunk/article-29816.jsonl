Osteoarthritis is the most common form, developing from gradual articular cartilage damage and subsequent thinning. This condition is considered a \u201cwear and tear\u201d injury, more common in older than younger patients. Osteoarthritis often correlates with prior injury and longstanding high-impact stress on the affected joint, usually from sports or excessive body weight. The degradation process itself does not cause pain because articular cartilage lacks innervation. However, pain arises due to articular cartilage thinning, stimulating pain fibers in nearby areas. The joint's damage response is synovial fluid production, leading to swelling and inflammation that stretches the highly innervated articular capsule\u00a0and causes joint pain and stiffness. Compression of the underlying bone also\u00a0results in pain, as bones are richly innervated.", "contents": "Anatomy, Joints -- Clinical Significance -- Synovial Joint Diseases.

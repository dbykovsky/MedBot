However, not all patients progress to visual morbidity. On average, progression is slower in NTG than POAG. Those at higher risk of visual field progression are females and those with a history of migraines, presence of optic disc hemorrhages, greater variation in diurnal IOP. [30] [47] [7] Patients who present with advanced disease or rapidly progressing visual field loss are most likely to be blinded by the condition, and these so-called \u2018rapid progressors\u2019 should be identified and treated more aggressively.

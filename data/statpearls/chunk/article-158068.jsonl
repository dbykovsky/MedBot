The administration of a single unit of citrated blood product can exacerbate this condition, potentially reducing ionized calcium to critical levels (<0.9 mmol/L). Though civilian data\u00a0have yet to support the practice,\u00a0the military Joint Trauma System (JTS) DCR\u00a0guidelines recommend that patients in hemorrhagic shock receive\u00a01 gram of intravenous or intraosseous calcium during or immediately following the transfusion of the initial unit of blood product. Calcium gluconate is considered safer than calcium chloride in the prehospital setting due to the possible\u00a0risk of extravasation.\u00a0Calcium administration should be repeated after every\u00a04 units of blood products during ongoing resuscitation. To prevent citrate toxicity, 1 gram of calcium should be administered for every\u00a04 units of blood product infused. [45] [46] [47]"}

The proposed upper limit during active resuscitation is 110 mm Hg. Current evidence suggests that this SBP range of 90 to 110 mm Hg in patients receiving blood products is optimal to enhance patient outcomes, and lower SBP targets in patients receiving crystalloids should help mitigate the risk of exacerbating coagulopathy and clot displacement.

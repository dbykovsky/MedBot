Hypertension with hypokalemia is one of the characteristic features of primary aldosteronism, especially in those individuals with a family history of hypertension and cerebrovascular accidents at a young age. The plasma aldosterone/renin ratio is the preferred screening test for primary aldosteronism and it should be done at least four weeks after the withdrawal of aldosterone antagonists and after the correction of hypokalemia. [47] Measurement of 24-hour urine aldosterone level after oral sodium loading and plasma aldosterone level after intravenous saline infusion are the diagnostic tests for primary aldosteronism, while renal vein sampling can be done for selected patients. Adrenal imaging is recommended for the localization of the lesion. [48]"}

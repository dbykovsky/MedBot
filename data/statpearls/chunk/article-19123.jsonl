Close follow-up with the psychiatrist to look for signs of depression and suicidal ideation."}

First-line medications for neuropathic pain are gabapentinoids and TCAs. Other considerations include SSRI/SNRI, transcranial electric stimulation, and physiotherapy. Spasticity should be managed with a regular stretching program and antispasmodic medications. Baclofen is the hallmark of spasticity management. Patients may require additional medicinal therapy in consultation with a pain specialist or neurologist for their neuropathic pain and spasticity. Also, providers should consider chemodenervation with botulinum toxin or alcohol injections. Lastly, baclofen pumps can be implanted as well.", "contents": "Central Cord Syndrome -- Pearls and Other Issues. Neuropathic pain and spasticity are common.

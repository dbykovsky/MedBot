Estrogen insufficiency especially predisposes postmenopausal\u00a0women and older men to osteoporosis through a variety of mechanisms, including increasing osteocyte apoptosis. While incompletely understood,\u00a0this has been postulated to be partially due to dysregulation between receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB ligand (RANKL), receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB (RANK) and osteoprotegerin (OPG), a decoy receptor the neutralizes RANKL.

Acute complications and supportive management, including blood pressure control, management of pulmonary edema, and monitoring volume status, can be managed by a hospitalist. Acute respiratory failure needing ventilator support and shock needing pressors may be comanaged by a hospitalist and an Intensivist. If the patient needs a large volume of blood products, it would be in the patient's best interest to have hematology involved in the care. A nephrologist may be involved if the patient develops acute kidney injury. Hepatology and surgical team involvement is needed if the patient develops complications like liver hematoma or rupture. Ophthalmologist input may be necessary if the patient develops any vision changes. A neonatologist may be involved early to avoid any neonatal complications."}

In the winter between 1914 and 1915, it is reported that over 20,000 British troops were treated for trench foot.\u00a0 Furthermore, it is estimated that trench foot contributed to the deaths of 2000 American and roughly 75,000 British soldiers. Interestingly, trench foot was first described in 1812 while Napoleon\u2019s army was retreating from Russia. Dr. Dominique Jean Larrey, a French army surgeon, was the first clinician to describe the condition.

The disease has been known to commonly affect the heels or toes, but can extend above the foot. The skin can appear blotchy, and as the disease progresses, blisters and open sores can occur which can lead to fungal as well as bacterial infections.

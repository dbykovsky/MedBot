In cases in which a stable patient presents for an evaluation of pelvic pain, abdominal pain, or vaginal bleeding early in suspected pregnancy, it is important first to establish a diagnosis of an IUP. If pelvic ultrasound reveals an IUP, it can be assumed that the cause of symptoms is unlikely to be secondary to an ectopic pregnancy. [30] However, it is important to consider heterotopic pregnancy, which is defined as the simultaneous presence of intrauterine and ectopic pregnancies; this condition is more common in women undergoing in-vitro fertilization (IVF) or women that have a history of tubal disease. The incidence of ectopic pregnancy is 0.006 to 0.001% in spontaneous cases, while in assisted reproductive techniques, such as IVF, it is 1 to 3%. [31] Once ectopic pregnancy is ruled out, other causes of vaginal bleeding or pelvic pain may be considered, such as spontaneous abortion, threatened abortion, gestational trophoblastic neoplasm, trauma, or most commonly normal pregnancy. Management of a stable patient with minimal bleeding in early pregnancy includes outpatient follow-up within 1 to 2 days and strict return precautions. It must be noted that for pelvic pain or vaginal bleeding complaints that occur later in pregnancy (>23 weeks), a speculum or digital vaginal exam should be held until placenta previa is ruled out by ultrasound. [6] Placenta previa accounts for 13 percent of maternal deaths secondary to hemorrhage in the United States in a recent report.\u00a0It is associated with other complications, including the need for blood transfusion, organ injury, need for hysterectomy, venous thromboembolism, and increased infection risk, making identification of placenta previa an important part of obstetric ultrasound.

{"id": "article-39034_23", "title": "Pregnancy Ultrasound Evaluation -- Clinical Significance", "content": "Trauma in pregnancy is the leading cause of non-obstetric maternal mortality. Non-lethal injuries during pregnancy most commonly occur from motor vehicle accidents and domestic/intimate partner violence. Although most injuries during pregnancy are classified as minor, fetal losses that are associated with minor trauma range from 60 to 70%. Importantly, any female of reproductive age with minor or major\u00a0injury should be assumed pregnant until proven otherwise. The immediate focus is always on stabilizing the patient. Once successfully stabilized, all female patients of reproductive age should undergo a definitive pregnancy test or an ultrasound scan. In the setting of trauma, the patient may not be conscious or able to report their pregnancy status or gestational age; thus, estimating gestational age with bedside ultrasound can be a useful tool. Identifying pregnancy and estimating gestational age\u00a0can help anticipate the need for prompt delivery. Ultrasound can assist in the evaluation of fetal cardiac rate and rhythm, amniotic fluid volume, placental localization, exclusion of previa, delineating possible fetal injury, and confirming fetal demise. If a patient is estimated to be >20 weeks gestation, fetal monitoring should be initiated as soon as possible in a stable patient.\u00a0In the setting of trauma in pregnancy, a critical concern is placental abruption, a condition that occurs most commonly in trauma in which the patient experiences intense and severe uterine pain, in addition to uterine contractions and vaginal bleeding. It is important to note that the use of ultrasound for detecting placental abruption has a poor sensitivity; however, it is very specific if identified; resulting in a positive predictive value of 88% if seen and a negative predictive value of 53% if not identified. Thus fetal prolonged monitoring is advised in pregnant patients with trauma. A follow-up obstetric ultrasound and examination should be done 2 weeks after any hospital admission for either maternal or fetal factors (regardless of the gestational age) to document and assess normalcy after the traumatic event.

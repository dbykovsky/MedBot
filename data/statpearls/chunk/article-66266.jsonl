A carotid incision is used to access the carotid sheath for carotid endarterectomy. It is made along the anterior aspect of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in a vertical direction. There needs to be are to avoid hitting the external jugular vein or the internal jugular vein. The incision will need to go through the platysma. [23]"}

A Visi port is a special port that allows for laparoscope placement in the trochar itself, then after an incision is made, direct visualization with twisting of the port and steady downward pressure is applied to gain access to the intraperitoneal space. When additional trochars are placed, it is wise to avoid any vessels that are traveling through the abdominal wall that may be illuminated by the laparoscope inserted through the previously inserted larger port. If access at the umbilical site is not advisable due to multiple surgeries, the presence of scar tissue, or large wall deformities, then the next best initial access site is the left upper abdomen. Decompression of both the stomach and bladder is recommended before any initial trochar insertion. [26]", "contents": "Surgical Access Incisions -- Issues of Concern -- Laparoscopic Incisions.

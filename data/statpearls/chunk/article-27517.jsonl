The recent development of the dorsal root ganglion stimulator to treat focal dermatomal neuropathic pain conditions is theoretically promising for PHN. One study originating from China in 2008 suggests that CT-guided radiofrequency ablation of the dorsal root ganglion may result in a significant reduction in symptomatology and sometimes complete resolution of PHN. However, the sample size was small, the technique may cause a pneumothorax, and repeat studies are lacking. Intrathecal medication administration also demonstrates promise. One 270-person study in 2000 investigated the use of intrathecal methylprednisolone with lidocaine for the treatment of PHN, resulting in a significant analgesic effect in ninety percent of patients through two years of follow-up.

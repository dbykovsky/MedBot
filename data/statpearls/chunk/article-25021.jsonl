Lupus mesenteric vasculitis (LMV) has been known to occur in up to 10% of patients with SLE, and the prevalence is highest in patients with active disease. [24] Immune complex deposition in the arterioles and venules causes occlusion of the mesenteric circulation, ultimately leading to intestinal ulceration and ischemia. The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies represents a predisposition to thrombosis in the intestinal vessels that can also contribute to ischemia. Abdominal pain is the commonest presenting symptom. The clinical spectrum of LMV can range anywhere from patchy intestinal edema to gangrene and perforation. [25] Patients with SLE presenting with abdominal symptoms require investigation with imaging. CT findings in LMV can include intestinal wall thickening, dilated bowel loops, abnormal enhancement of the bowel wall (target sign), occlusion in the mesenteric circulation, and ascites. [26]"}

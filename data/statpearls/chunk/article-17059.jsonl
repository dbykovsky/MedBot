During the clinical assessment for injury to CN XI (Spinal Accessory Nerve, SAN), the\u00a0trapezius and sternocleidomastoid\u00a0are assessed for strength and mass.\u00a0 The trapezius is assessed by asking the patient to shrug his or her shoulders with and without resistance, and the sternocleidomastoid is tested by asking the patient to turn\u00a0his or her head to the left or right against resistance. Inspection of the muscles may reveal wasting or fasciculations. [8]"}

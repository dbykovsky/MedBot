Bisphosphonates mimic PPi and bind with high affinity to hydroxyapatite crystals found within areas of remodeling bone. The bound drug is released from its bound hydroxyapatite as osteoclasts begin to resorb bone. The freed drug then leads to apoptosis of osteoclasts via inhibition of the enzyme farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase. This enzyme is involved in metabolic pathways responsible for the production of cholesterol and other lipids. Despite the ubiquitous nature of this enzyme, bisphosphonate-induced apoptosis via inhibition of farnesyl pyrophosphate only appears in osteoclasts. Pamidronate and the other newer (nitrogen-containing) bisphosphonates induce osteoclast apoptosis via this mechanism, while earlier (non-nitrogen-containing) bisphosphonates do so via disruption of several intracellular ATP-dependent processes.

MRI spine, CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis, bone marrow biopsy, PET imaging, and testis ultrasound in select cases, can be done in the staging process. [3] [5] PET imaging can be more sensitive for detecting systemic disease than conventional CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and bone marrow biopsy can detect disease not evident in other imaging modalities in the staging process. [3] Baseline levels of LDH, HIV, as well as hepatitis B, and C serology, are often done. Also, since 15 to 25% of patients with CNS lymphoma also have intraocular involvement, an ophthalmologic slit-lamp examination is standard. MRI brain with contrast along with CSF evaluation should also be obtained in patients diagnosed with intraocular lymphoma since 80% of these patients ultimately develop lymphoma in other areas of their central nervous system. [5] Optical coherence tomography and fluorescence angiography can also be options in the diagnosis and staging of intraocular lymphoma."}

Due to their close proximity, the obturator muscles are clinically relevant when there is an injury to the hip, such as dislocation. Posterior hip dislocations are the most common type of hip dislocation. They are typically caused when a posteriorly directed force is applied to a flexed knee while the hip is flexed and adducted. This drives the femoral head posteriorly and causes dislocation of the hip. During dislocation, gluteal muscles and short external rotator muscles, such as the obturator internus, can be injured. However, the most common complications from posterior hip dislocation are avascular necrosis and sciatic nerve injury. The deep branch of the MCFA is the primary blood supply of the femoral head. Damage to this vessel dramatically increases the likelihood of avascular necrosis. Studies have shown that the obturator externus plays a vital role in the protection of the deep branch of the MCFA during hip dislocation in any direction. [4] After posterior hip dislocation, hip stabilizer muscles are monitored in gait analysis and muscle rehabilitation. [7]"}

The abrupt withdrawal of the galantamine, immediate or delayed-release, in patients who have been taking dosages within the effective range is not associated with higher incidences of adverse events when compared with the group of patients who continue to receive the same dosages of galantamine. However, the beneficial effects of the galantamine are lost when the medicine is discontinued. If donepezil, another acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, is ineffective or poorly tolerated by the patient, a switch to galantamine may be beneficial. [39]"}

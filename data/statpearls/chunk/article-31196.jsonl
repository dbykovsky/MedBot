In the simplest terms, the eyes normally receive input from the environment, and then various cells detect and transmit signals to the brain. For visual discrimination, specifically, the visual cortex, contained within the occipital lobe, is the area responsible for detecting the shape and orientation of objects. Three cell types in the primary visual cortex (simple, complex, and hypercomplex) display correspondingly increased ability to respond to motion and degree of linearity. A more in-depth explanation of the visual cortex is a separate neuroanatomy topic. [1]", "contents": "Visual Discrimination -- Definition/Introduction.

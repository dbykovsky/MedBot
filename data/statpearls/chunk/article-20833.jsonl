Computed tomography of the temporal bone\u00a0may be indicated in the presence of signs of acute middle ear infection, trauma, or cholesteatoma. Magnetic resonance imaging may be warranted in findings of facial nerve palsy or unilateral sensorineural deafness. The identification of any hearing loss can guide further formalized hearing tests such as pure-tone audiometry and tympanometry. Findings may also prompt surgical planning; for example, in the presence of cholesteatoma, large tympanic membrane perforation, or pinna abnormalities.", "contents": "Ear Examination -- Clinical Significance.

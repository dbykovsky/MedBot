[38] A study indicates that sleep bruxism in children is associated with increased health problems and increased internalizing behaviors such as being anxious, depressed, withdrawn, and expressing somatic complaints. Increased frequency of health problems is, in turn, associated with decreased neurocognitive performance. As health problems increase, neurocognitive performance decreases, raising the possibility that sleep bruxism in children is an indicator of current or future adverse health conditions and the need for early intervention.

Depending on its association with underlying medical conditions, it can manifest as primary or secondary, with various factors contributing to its development. Sleep-related microarousals correlate with sleep bruxism, whereas stress and heightened alertness often cause awake bruxism. Risk factors include sleep apnea, anxiety, genetic predisposition, sleep disorders, medication use, and neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Given the diverse range of potential underlying comorbidities, effective care coordination necessitates integrating services across healthcare settings and disciplines, ensuring smooth transitions and continuity of care.", "contents": "Bruxism Management -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

Previously, diagnosing renal obstruction in this patient group was limited to two options: 1) using furosemide regardless of hypersensitivity because, in most cases, allergic reactions are practically mild or 2) resorting to the less accurate non-diuretic route for patients with known severe reactions to sulfa drugs. An article from the Journal of Nuclear Medicine discusses how this dilemma led to ethacrynic acid replacing furosemide during diuretic renal scintigraphy. In looking for an alternative to furosemide, researchers discovered that many loop diuretics, including thiazides and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, are composed of sulfonamide moieties. Because of this, in addition to intravenous ethacrynic acid's nearly 100 percent bioavailability and rapid onset of action, it has become a favorable option for these patients.[4]", "contents": "Ethacrynic Acid -- Indications.

These ions retained in tubular fluid create an electrochemical gradient that prevents reabsorption of calcium and magnesium as well.

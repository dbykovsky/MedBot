In patients who provide reasonable effort during the test and reach a normal VO 2 peak (good effort without reaching VO 2 max) and who state dyspnea or fatigue was their limiting factor during exercise, we can assume that they have a normal exercise tolerance. In this case, we can assume that a cardiopulmonary issue such as CHF, interstitial lung disease (ILD), or COPD was absent. We would be more likely to see an abnormal VO 2 peak with significant dyspnea when testing these patients."}

Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (exercise-induced asthma) is another pulmonary pathology to consider. It presents as difficulty breathing and wheezing during or after exercise. Objectively, it can be indicated by FEV1 decrease greater than 10% compared to baseline.", "contents": "Physiology, Exercise -- Pathophysiology.

The increased demand on the heart can lead to myocardial strain. This issue becomes intensified in high-temperature or high-humidity exercise conditions. In response to the impaired evaporative cooling, vasodilation occurs to reduce body temperature, which leads to a compensatory increase in heart rate, which causes additional strain on the myocardial tissue.", "contents": "Physiology, Exercise -- Pathophysiology.

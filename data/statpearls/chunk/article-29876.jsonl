TTS is an uncommon but underdiagnosed cause of foot and ankle pain. Patients present with pain from the tarsal tunnel radiating down to the plantar foot, though symptoms can vary. No diagnostic modality can specifically\u00a0identify TTS. The diagnosis is clinical, but various studies can help rule out treatable causes. Conservative therapy can be tried in most patients. Surgical decompression can provide good results if a definitive cause amenable to surgery is identified.", "contents": "Tarsal Tunnel Syndrome -- Pearls and Other Issues.

{"id": "article-19499_1", "title": "Neuroanatomy, Choroid Plexus -- Structure and Function -- CSF Production", "content": "The brain is composed of three layers of meninges known as the dura mater, arachnoid mater, and the pia mater. The choroid plexus resides in the innermost layer of the meninges (pia mater) which is in close contact with the cerebral cortex and spinal cord. It is a highly organized tissue that lines all the ventricles of the brain except the frontal/occipital horn of the lateral ventricles and the cerebral aqueduct. The choroid plexus has a lining of specialized epithelial tissue known as ependyma. Ependymal cells are glial cells with a ciliated\u00a0simple columnar form that line the ventricles and central canal of the spinal cord. Apical surfaces have a covering of hair-like projections known as cilia (which circulate CSF) and microvilli (which help in CSF absorption). Microvilli perform this function via their brush border, which significantly increases the surface area of the choroid plexus, permitting increased CSF absorption.\u00a0Ependymal cells are essential in the production of CSF as the choroid plexus may secrete up to 500ml of CSF per day in the adult human brain. [1] Not only does CSF cushion and support the brain/spinal cord, but it acts as a filtration system to circulate nutrients and remove metabolic waste from the central nervous system. Cerebrospinal fluid flows to the third ventricle from the lateral ventricles via the right and left interventricular foramen of Monro. CSF then flows from the third to the fourth ventricle via the cerebral aqueduct of Sylvius. Lastly, CSF flows from the fourth ventricle to the subarachnoid space via the foramen of Magendie medially and via the foramen of Luschka laterally. Once CSF is in the subarachnoid space, it may be reabsorbed via arachnoid granulations and ultimately drain into the dural venous sinuses. Because CSF pressure associates with brain development, too little CSF can stunt brain growth whereas overproduction of CSF can lead to a condition known as hydrocephalus.\u00a0Fortunately,\u00a0excessive CSF production as a cause of hydrocephalus does not occur except in rare cases of a tumor of the choroid plexus known as choroid plexus papilloma which may cause hydrocephalus by overproduction of CSF.", "contents": "Neuroanatomy, Choroid Plexus -- Structure and Function -- CSF Production.

This barrier is composed of a combination of ependymal (choroid epithelial) cells with tight junctions on its apical surface (the side facing the ventricles), and a core of fenestrated capillaries surrounded by connective tissue. Tight junctions consist of a network of claudins and proteins that serve as a checkpoint to limit the passage of substances between the cells. The blood-CSF barrier\u00a0functions similarly to the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) in that it facilitates the exchange and removal of metabolites while simultaneously preventing the passage of blood-borne substances into the brain. However,\u00a0the substances exchanged between each respective barrier differ significantly due to their distinct functions. For instance, the choroid plexus contains a fenestrated endothelium (BBB is non-fenestrated) which allows the rapid delivery of water to aid in CSF production. Within the choroid plexus reside microglia, white blood cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes which all serve to prevent harmful pathogens from entering, this permits normal brain homeostasis via cytokines that the choroid plexus secretes to recruit these immune cells.

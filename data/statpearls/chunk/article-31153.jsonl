Cholera infection rates and outbreaks have been closely linked to the socioeconomic characteristics of the region. [64] Cholera\u00a0reveals how a country's socioeconomic status can propagate a preventable disease. This circumstance has led\u00a0to increased research and teamwork between public health, government, and medical authorities\u00a0to develop oral cholera vaccines and improve implementation practices and strategies.

{"id": "article-31153_43", "title": "Vibrio cholerae Infection -- Pearls and Other Issues", "content": "Key facts to keep in mind regarding V cholerae infection are as follows: Cholera is an acute secretory diarrheal illness caused by the toxin of the comma-shaped gram-negative V cholerae bacterium that is known worldwide for its pandemic potential. Cholera affects resource-poor and developing countries lacking water, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructure. Historically, it has been responsible for 7 pandemics. Currently, it is endemic in\u00a069 countries, with particular severity in Sub-Saharan\u00a0Africa and the Middle East. [65] Infection begins with the ingestion of food or water contaminated with V cholerae. V cholerae subsequently colonizes the small intestine and produces toxins that\u00a0induce changes in the electrolyte channels in the small intestine, causing massive fluid\u00a0and electrolyte loss, clinically manifesting as\u00a0watery diarrhea.", "contents": "Vibrio cholerae Infection -- Pearls and Other Issues.

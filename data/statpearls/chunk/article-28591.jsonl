An interprofessional team of clinicians, nurses, and technicians trained in interpreting an ECG is necessary to achieve this goal. An emergency department nurse trained in the potential implications of axis deviation can help clinicians provide prompt and prudent diagnostic and therapeutic care for the patient. A cardiac specialty-trained nurse can assist clinicians in monitoring patients with acute cardiac pathology to help treat potential complications. A nurse well-versed in interpreting an ECG, especially in determining the electrical axis and its significance, should communicate the findings to the clinicians.

Hyperreflexia , designated by a reflex score of 3 or 4, is often a supportive exam finding in patients with upper motor neuron (UMN) lesions or injury, grossly meaning an injury to the CNS. A UMN lesion is also frequently concomitant with exam findings of muscle spasticity and the absence of muscle fasciculations and is commonly associated with conditions such as paraplegia, tetraplegia, hemiplegia, and diplegia. [12] [13] [14] Hyporeflexia , designated by a reflex score of\u00a00 or 1, is often a supportive exam finding in patients with lower motor neuron (LMN) lesions or injury, grossly meaning damage to the PNS, for example, the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord, nerve roots, peripheral nerves, or the neuromuscular junction or the muscle itself. An LMN lesion is also frequently concomitant with exam findings of muscle flaccidity, hypotonia, and fasciculations and is commonly associated with conditions such as myopathies and neuropathies."}

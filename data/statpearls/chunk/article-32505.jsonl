[13] The most widely practiced prevention for spina bifida is folic acid supplementation, with preconception use more beneficial than use in pregnancy. In spina bifida, the spinal cord is exposed to the amniotic fluid that contributes to the further damage of the nervous tissues. Newly practiced in-utero surgical procedures to prevent the neurodegeneration of the exposed spinal cord have helped preserve the structures and improve outcomes.

Most central nervous system (CNS) malformations are recognizable during routine laboratory screening and ultrasound scans. A second trimester elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in triple screen raises a very high suspicion for neural tube defects. [49] Further diagnostic workup is required if any abnormalities are detected. [13] Treatment of congenital malformation of the CNS requires a multidisciplinary approach and supportive management such as antiepileptics, gastrostomy tubes, and other surgical modalities.

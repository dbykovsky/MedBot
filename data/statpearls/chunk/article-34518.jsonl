An example of modern technology is barcode medication administration (BCMA), which allows nurses to verify the five rights of medication administration by electronically scanning a patient's wristband to confirm the information and crossmatch with a patient's electronic medical chart. [9] Barcode administration has been shown to decrease the incidence of medication administration errors ranging from 23% to 56% of the time in observational studies, although little evidence exists regarding the severity of medical errors with barcode administration. [9] In one observational study conducted by Marcias et al., the authors observed a statistically significant reduction in specific types of errors with the implementation of the barcode administration, including wrong medication, administration omission, wrong dose, and wrong order of administration.", "contents": "Nursing Rights of Medication Administration -- Clinical Significance.

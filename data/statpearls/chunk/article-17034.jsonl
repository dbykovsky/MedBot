PET CT utilizes 18-F-fluorodeoxyglucose, a\u00a0radiopharmaceutical agent for\u00a0diagnosis and staging of treatment for neoplasms. There are 2 separate acquisitions, PET followed by CT during the study. The CT is used for attenuation correction and anatomic localization. Typically the CT is performed without intravenous contrast. However, the study may be performed with intravenous and oral contrast based on the indication of the examination. PET-CT is useful in most malignant lesions and,\u00a0with respect to mediastinal masses, is typically used for lymphoma, esophageal, and lung malignancies.

In an anteroposterior (AP) view, the cassette is along the posterior aspect of the patient. Portable radiographs are obtained in the ICU setting when the patient cannot be erect. CT chest is performed with the patient supine. The arms are usually above the level of the head. MRI and PET scans are also obtained with the patient in the supine position. Ultrasound is also obtained with the patient usually supine.

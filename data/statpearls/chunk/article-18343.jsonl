In some circumstances, monitoring of biochemical markers of bone resorption such as N-telopeptide of type-1 collagen, C-terminal telopeptide of type 1-collagen and pyridinoline cross-links, and markers of bone formation such as bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and N-terminal propeptide of type 1 procollagen before and three months after bisphosphonate initiation can help monitor the effectiveness of the medication in inhibiting bone resorption and measuring compliance. However, these assays are fraught with significant variability within individual patients and poor standardization, so they are not routinely used. Alkaline phosphatase should be monitored at 6 to 12 weeks after the treatment initiation in patients with a history of Paget disease and should be repeated at 6-month to 12-month intervals.

[36] Optimal laboratory accreditation includes onsite inspection every other year with an annual requirement for self-inspection; reviews of laboratory validation, procedures, quality assurance results, processes, results, and reports; and unsatisfactory performance results in suspension of laboratory testing for HER2 for that method.

An interprofessional team is critical for diagnosing, managing symptoms, optimizing nutrition, treating with tafamidis, monitoring cardiac function, and managing the adverse effects of the treatments.\u00a0Therefore, an integrated interprofessional healthcare team is required, including primary care physicians, cardiologists, neurologists, hematologists, pathologists, radiologists, nursing staff, and pharmacists. Due to non-specific clinical presentation, a high degree of clinical suspicion is\u00a0necessary from clinicians. The disease is usually suspected based on symptoms, electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiography, cardiac biomarkers, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Suspected cases of cardiac amyloidosis should undergo screening for monoclonal protein to rule out AL amyloidosis (light chain), followed by myocardial scintigraphy or cardiac biopsy as needed.

They do not offer any clinical benefit and instead can cause symptomatic hypotension. The nursing staff must give supportive treatment in consultation with the cardiologists until more definitive treatment is initiated. Tafamidis is currently the most expensive cardiovascular medication, with a yearly cost of $225,000. Therefore, clinicians must start it only after explaining the cost and expected benefit to the patient in consultation with the pharmaceutical company and the medical insurer. An integrated multidisciplinary program is required, along with a dedicated pharmacist, to ensure the availability and affordability of tafamidis.

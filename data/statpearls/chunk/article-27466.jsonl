Anxiety and depression\u00a0may exacerbate symptom intensity. Pharmacological management with opioid and nonopioid analgesics is widely used in practice. Nonpharmacological strategies help reduce opioid requirements and include scalp blocks and radiofrequency nerve ablation. PCH prevention is a valuable part of treatment because it minimizes exposure to potentially harmful treatments. Alternative modalities like acupuncture and massage may be considered in chronic cases, but these treatments have not been widely proven in clinical studies. PCH preventive treatments have not proven effective 48 hours after surgery. Acute and chronic PCH can reduce function and quality of life.

While the patient is being worked up, the pharmacist should educate the patient on the need for medication compliance if the clinician discovered a clot in the deep veins. The pharmacist should also verify dosing and administration with anticoagulant therapy, and report any concerns to the prescriber. Also, the nurse should educate the patient on the importance of wearing compression stockings to prevent the post-phlebitic syndrome, and evaluate therapeutic results at each follow-up visit. Even when the primary cause of thrombophlebitis gets diagnosed and treated, phlebitis itself also requires treatment. Failing to administer anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis can result in pulmonary embolism and medical malpractice. The entire interprofessional healthcare team must collaborate and communicate in looking after the patient to obtain the best outcomes. [Level 5]"}

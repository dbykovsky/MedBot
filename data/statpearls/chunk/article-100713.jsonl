Although 2 in 5 patients above the age of 65 have a disability, anyone can become disabled at any time in their life. The number of disabled persons is forecasted to be a rapidly growing statistic for several reasons. One reason is the incidence and prevalence of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. The aforementioned chronic conditions are all risk factors for disability, and as a result of their increase, the incidence of disability will too increase.\u00a0 Another reason is the increase in life expectancy due to advances in medicine and surgery. More people are surviving what would previously be considered a life-ending ailment. However, a common complication of surviving one of these previously life-ending ailments is residual limb deformity, chronic pain, and impaired mobility, to list a few.

It is important to highlight that not all impairments lead to a disability. Disability can be further categorized into temporary or permanent and partial or total disability.

Doing so can be productive and therapeutic. Modified work programs include either decreased or flexible work hours, decreased required shift tasks, and/or workplace modifications to accommodate needs. If the patient has no opportunity to have a temporary or modified job, then the patient may require a temporary total disability claim until MMI is achieved.\u00a0 The Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE) is a standardized assessment of an injured individual\u2019s ability to return to a transitional, modified work environment. The FCE may require performance-based tests using job-specific equipment in a simulated or real environment. An additional Job Site Evaluation (JSE) can be obtained by using a specially trained therapist to assess the functions of the job and the physical demands required. [18]"}

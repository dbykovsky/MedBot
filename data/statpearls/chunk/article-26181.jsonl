The drug is relatively safe, but prescribers, including nurse practitioners, primary care providers, internists, surgeons, and emergency department physicians, need to monitor the drug in specific populations. Due to the potential for dose-dependent QTc interval prolongation, clinicians should monitor\u00a0EKG, potassium, and magnesium levels in a susceptible population. It includes the elderly or patients with electrolyte abnormalities such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients on other medications that may prolong the QTc interval. Current evidence does not demonstrate a need to pre-screen this population before administering ondansetron for patients without any of the above risk factors."}

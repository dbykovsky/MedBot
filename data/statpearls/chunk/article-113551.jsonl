This includes expertise in recognizing the varied clinical presentations and understanding the nuances of diagnostic techniques such as neurologic deficits and neuroimaging.\u00a0These teams have been shown to improve early detection and cessation of seizures. Patient and caregiver education about triggering factors, medication compliance, auras, and other ictal symptoms are essential to prevent morbidity from lacunar strokes."}

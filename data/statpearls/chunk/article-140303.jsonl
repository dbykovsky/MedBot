[22] There are no clear guidelines for continuing somatostatin analogs as maintenance post-PRRT. Fewer studies have indicated possible clinical benefits of combining PRRT with somatostatin analogs, preferably in patients with functional neuroendocrine tumors. [23] [24] The limitations of 177 Lu-dotatate at present also include the complexity of administration. The 177 Lu-dotatate infusion is currently administered in the nuclear medicine department and needs thorough communication with medical oncology."}

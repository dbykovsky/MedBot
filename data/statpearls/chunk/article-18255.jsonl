Previous reports have documented as high as a 45% revision surgery rate for residual biceps/groove pain following biceps tenodesis. [63] A 2015 study from Burkhart and colleagues contrasted previous reports suggesting high revision surgery rates and postoperative persistent/residual groove pain following tenodesis procedures.\u00a0Burkhart's study was a retrospective multicenter study that reported follow-up results from 7 different surgeons performing an all-arthroscopic biceps tenodesis procedure [64] : 1083 patients, with a mean follow-up of 136 weeks Revision surgery rate: 4.1% Revision related to complications or symptoms attributed to the actual biceps tenodesis: 0.4% Cosmetic (\"Popeye\") deformity: 5% to 10% Muscle spasm/cramping: 5% to 10% Biceps pain: 5% to 10%"}

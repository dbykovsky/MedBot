A systematic review of randomized controlled trials comparing surgical intervention versus conservative therapy yielded moderate evidence that surgical intervention was not more effective for reducing pain than impingement-directed physical therapy. [24] Arthroscopic subacromial decompression (ASD) consists of acromioplasty at the anterolateral edge, bursal debridement, and resection of the coracoacromial ligament. [2] The ASD or other similar procedure is recommended when a patient has severe, persistent subacromial shoulder pain with functional impairments that have not improved despite conservative therapy. [1] [12] [17] Combined ASD and treatments such as radiofrequency ablation and arthroscopic bursectomy have more beneficial effects than open subacromial decompression (OSD) plus platelet-leukocyte gel injection. [15] However, a 2018 systematic review found there was no additional benefit in pain reduction when comparing the results of ASD surgery to placebo surgery at 12 months. [25] Alternative surgical options include acromioplasty or bursectomy alone, though, like ASD, these surgical interventions appear to provide minimal benefit to patients. [26]"}

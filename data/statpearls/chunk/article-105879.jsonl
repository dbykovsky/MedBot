If acute upper airway obstruction goes untreated, it can result in respiratory distress, which causes bradycardia and tiring of the patient, ultimately leading to loss of consciousness and cardiorespiratory arrest. [43] If upper airway obstruction is due to foreign body aspiration, it can be acutely fatal. Smaller size foreign body can enter the lungs causing atelectasis, pneumonia, or pneumothorax."}

In acute settings, a pulmonologist can perform a flexible bronchoscopy in a child with an inhaled foreign body, which is in a distal bronchus. Moreover, rigid equipment regularly utilized by otorhinolaryngologists is very effective for more proximal foreign bodies. Cardiothoracic surgeons can also become involved in these cases where removing the foreign body via the airway is difficult, as the patient may require a thoracotomy if the foreign body is in a distal airway and cannot be removed endoscopically.", "contents": "Upper Airway Obstruction -- Consultations.

Cinacalcet, a calcimimetic that mitigates the increase in PTH, is increasingly taking center stage. When formulating a multi-modal approach for conditions such as calciphylaxis, CKD, and hyperparathyroidism, this medication emerges as a cornerstone in the medical toolkit. Optimal outcomes with cinacalcet therapy are achieved through the collaboration of an interprofessional healthcare team comprising clinicians, advanced practice providers, endocrinologists, nephrologists, nurses, and pharmacists.

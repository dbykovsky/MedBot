Clouded mentation or sedation following\u00a0codeine initiation tends to fade\u00a0over time. However, during initiation or dosage adjustments, patients should be counseled by their prescribing clinician about the drug's ability to affect their cognitive state, especially if that patient intends to drive or operate heavy machinery while on the medication until tolerance develops to this\u00a0adverse effect.\u00a0When\u00a0prescribed\u00a0codeine, patients should also receive counsel regarding the risk associated with exposure to other mind-altering substances.

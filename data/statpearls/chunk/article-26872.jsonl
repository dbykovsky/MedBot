In over half of cases of chronic pelvic pain, there is comorbid endometriosis, pelvic adhesions, irritable bowel, or interstitial cystitis. [4] [5] Furthermore, multiple comorbidities can be present simultaneously alongside chronic pelvic pain. [4] [6] Chronic pelvic pain is a form of reflex dystrophy, where there is both a neurological component to symptoms, as well as a psychological component.

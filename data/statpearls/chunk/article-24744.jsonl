Elective replacement of aortic root disease in advance of critical enlargement has been shown to be integral as illustrated in a series of 675 patients with MFS from Johns Hopkins in which the 30-day mortality for elective, urgent (within 7 days of surgical consultation), or emergency repair (within 24 hours of consultation) was 1.5%, 2.6%, and 11.7%, respectively. [74] In another review, the\u00a0actuarial survival\u00a0at 5, 10, and 20 years\u00a0of 231 patients who underwent elective aortic root replacement at Johns Hopkins was 88%, 81%, and 75%, respectively. [75] The 2010\u00a0ACC/AHA/AATS guidelines recommend an elective operation for patients with MFS at an external diameter of equal to 50 mm to avoid acute dissection or rupture. [31] Indications for surgical repair at an external diameter less than 50 mm include rapid growth (greater than 5\u00a0mm per year),\u00a0family history of an aortic dissection at a diameter less than 50 mm, or presence of progressive aortic valve regurgitation. The guidelines indicate if the maximal cross-sectional area (square centimeters) of the ascending aorta or root, divided by the patient's height in meters is greater than 10, surgical repair is appropriate.

Microwave radiofrequency ablation of the nerve appears to be a promising treatment modality for ilioinguinal neuralgia, especially when ultrasound guidance is used, as the therapy tip needs to be placed immediately adjacent to the nerve for the procedure to be successful. [33] In one study of 42 patients with ilioinguinal neuralgia and chronic pain, microwave nerve ablation provided substantially longer durations of pain relief of 12.5 months than nerve infiltration with local anesthetic, which lasted 1.6 months. [34] Another study of 10 patients showed that 83% had an average reduction of almost 70% in reported pain. [35] [36] [35]"}

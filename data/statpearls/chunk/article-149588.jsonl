[18] Clindamycin, a lincosamide antibiotic, is known to have a higher incidence of adverse effects such as rashes and diarrhea. However, a more severe adverse effect associated with clindamycin use is the development of pseudomembranous colitis, which occurs in approximately 2% of individuals who receive this medication. Cases of pseudomembranous colitis can occur up to 6 weeks after completing therapy, highlighting the importance of monitoring patients closely even after treatment completion.

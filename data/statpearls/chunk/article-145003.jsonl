Raw EEG possesses a significant advantage over processed EEG when monitoring for depth of consciousness. EEG waveforms are altered in consistent and reproducible ways\u00a0when anesthetics are present at clinically relevant concentrations. [32] However, the utility of raw EEG monitoring is significantly limited due to the relative inability of most practitioners to accurately interpret raw EEG data, thus creating a significant market for processed EEG monitors, however useful they may or may not be in detecting levels of consciousness.

Immediate assessment in the PACU, either in response to a patient report of awareness or when suspected by a clinician, should focus on an open-ended discussion whereby the patient is permitted to relate their experience in detail. Dismissal of related events or justification for awareness from the practitioner at this point is inadvisable, and it is paramount to validate the concerns raised by the patient early in their recovery. Expressing regret for unpleasant experiences is both ethically sound and important for patients to hear. Expression of regret for untoward outcomes, and in many states, even apologizing for them, cannot be used against a practitioner as evidence of negligence in a malpractice claim.", "contents": "Intraoperative and Anesthesia Awareness -- Clinical Significance -- Management of AAGA.

Patients with suspected airway obstruction due to a mediastinal mass on physical examination should undergo pulmonary function tests (PFTs) with flow-volume loops.\u00a0The tests should be performed\u00a0in both the upright and supine positions. If the PFTs show obstruction while supine during inhalation, the patient's mass is extrathoracic; if the obstruction occurs during expiration, the patient's mass is intrathoracic. A review of CT imaging can be\u00a0extremely\u00a0helpful in\u00a0evaluating\u00a0any compression or deviation of the great vessels."}

Although G6PD deficiency is diagnosed in patients worldwide, the deficiency is more common along the malaria belts of Asia, the Mediterranean, sub-Saharan Africa, and the Middle East. [27] The most common form of G6PD deficiency is a genetic disorder, and patients will often report a family history of episodic hemolytic anemia triggered by certain drugs or infections. Qualitative testing for enzymatic activity is diagnostic. [28] Patients with the most common type of G6PD deficiency experience no symptoms unless exposed to fava beans, certain drugs, or infections that precipitate hemolysis of red blood cells. [27] Pharmaceutical triggers of episodic hemolysis include nitrofurantoin, dapsone, primaquine, ribavirin, and rifampin.

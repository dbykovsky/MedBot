[1] During endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement, a small incision is made over the anterior abdominal wall through which the tube is placed via a push method (the tube inserted percutaneously through the incision) or a pull technique (the tube is pulled out from the stomach through the incision). Once the tube is placed, a fistulous gastrocutaneous tract is formed in about 2-4 weeks. However, in certain conditions such as severe malnutrition, immunocompromised patients, and large ascites, tract maturity is further delayed. If a percutaneous gastrostomy endoscopic (PEG) tube is dislodged within a month after placement, then endoscopic replacement is recommended. However, if the tube is dislodged after 4 to 6 weeks when tract maturity is expected, bedside replacement is usually sufficient.

Patients diagnosed with peripheral vascular disease require a reasoned approach to account for age, risk factors, disease severity, and functional status. Management is divided into two broad categories aimed at decreasing cardiovascular events and improving symptoms. Persons with PAD are at increased risk of\u00a0coronary artery disease mortality (relative risk = 6.6), cardiovascular mortality (relative risk = 5.9), and all-cause mortality (relative risk = 3.1). [32] Therefore PAD management begins with\u00a0lifestyle modification\u00a0to prevent disease progression with the addition of medical and interventional therapy required\u00a0for improved symptomatic control and cardiovascular event risk reduction."}

To improve the function of the respiratory muscles and the muscles that affect the rib cage, respecting the sternal wound, it is possible to perform a MET.\u00a0When the pain has improved, other more comprehensive approaches (such as unwinding or more challenging rehabilitation exercises) can increase the patient's ability to breathe and move.", "contents": "Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment: Muscle Energy Procedure - Exhaled Ribs -- Clinical Significance. When\u00a0should clinicians choose to perform a MET? This technique has no side effects. The concept of this approach is to exploit the force that the patient can express, respecting the physiological limits without creating pain or discomfort.\u00a0The technique can also be used to prepare for other techniques, such as high-velocity low-amplitude (HVLA) or more demanding stretches, and prepare the ribs for more effective work on the diaphragm muscle.\u00a0For example, after a sternotomy cardiac surgery, patients may present positional changes in the rib joints, causing pain.

In this case,\u00a0the treating clinician must know that MET can increase the rib's range of motion (ROM), improving the afferent/efferent\u00a0picture of the treated area. Still, precisely because of the scar presence, it is likely that the reduction of the ROM can return. In this situation, it is not wrong to reschedule visits for the patient and periodically carry out this manual technique to obtain more lasting maintenance of muscle and joint movement.", "contents": "Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment: Muscle Energy Procedure - Exhaled Ribs -- Clinical Significance.

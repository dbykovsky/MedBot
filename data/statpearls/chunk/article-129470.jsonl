Prior to the exam, the child could be asked to hold parental oral intake for 6\u00a0to 8 hours, as light sedation is required at times for younger children. The patient will be asked to lay supine on the exam table or bed, with the head of the bed at roughly a 30-degree angle. If possible, the lateral decubitus position can provide optimal images given the gravitational pull of the heart towards the surface. In infants, the parent may wish to hold the patient for simplicity. Distractors are provided when needed. A few electrodes will be placed on the child to allow ECG gated images.

Such a defined systematic approach provides simplicity to interpreting each individual cTTE.

This is done by starting with the subcostal view to identify the apex, ventricles, and great vessels.

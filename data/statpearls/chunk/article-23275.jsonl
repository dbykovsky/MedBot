Once patients are on a stable dose of calcium and calcitriol, the frequency of monitoring can be reduced to every 3\u00a0to 6 months. The absence of PTH reduces the renal tubular reabsorption of calcium. Therefore, patients treated for hypoparathyroidism are at risk of urolithiasis or renal and other soft tissue calcifications. [9] [21] These risks can be minimized by titrating therapy to keep the serum calcium level in the low-normal range. In most cases, keeping serum calcium in that range is sufficient to prevent muscle cramps and paresthesias while reducing the risk of extraskeletal calcifications or kidney stones. [2] [3] Urine calcium should periodically be measured to ensure that patients do not develop hypercalciuria. A urine calcium excretion of over 200\u00a0to 250 mg daily should alert clinicians that the calcium and vitamin D dose needs to be reduced. An alternative strategy is to add hydrochlorothiazide to reduce urinary calcium excretion. [20]"}

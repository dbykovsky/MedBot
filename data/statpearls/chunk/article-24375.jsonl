Dose constraints for normal structures such as normal liver parenchyma, kidneys, spinal cord, stomach, heart, and small bowel must be evaluated. Task Group-101, which was published by the American Academy of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM), and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines provide dose constraints for SBRT for 1, 3, and 5 fraction courses. [22] [23] What is critical is the amount of normal liver receiving less than 15Gy should be greater than 700cc in a 3-fraction course of SBRT and less than 21Gy for a 5-fraction course which minimizes the risk of radiation-induced liver disease (RILD). Bowel dose can also be challenging to meet dose constraints depending on the location of the metastasis."}

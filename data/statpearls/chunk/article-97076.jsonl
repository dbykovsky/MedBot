Monocanalicular stents have been introduced, which makes the removal of the stent easier in the clinic. Eustis et al., who investigated 186 eyes with CNLDO, found the success with monocanalicular stents to be 93% compared to 78% for bicanalicular stent insertion (p = 0.00653). [35] Primary silicone stent intubation as the initial intervention has been shown to have a success rate of 90% in children aged 6 months to 45 months with the tubes retained for between two and five months. [18] Risks of silicone stent intubation include premature loss of the stent, corneal erosion, conjunctival injury, punctal, and canalicular trauma, the formation of granulomas, and retained silicone stents after attempted removal."}

Assuming that it is the right sac that is affected, he places his right thumb over the sac in a way to shut off the return flow through the puncta. This is done by holding the thumb sidewise, with the thumbnail outward and forming an acute angle with the plane of the iris. The edge of the thumb is now pressed down over the puncta, compress\u00ac ing it against the rim of the orbit; with this point of pressure maintained, the thumb is rotated to the right, at the same time pressing downward, abruptly, over the sac. The fluid, now being compressed by the thumb, transmits the pressure to the walls of the sac, which must give way at its weakest point, which happens to be the site of the nasal opening. Repeated cures after one manipulation of this sort, and no failures so far, extending over a period of seven years, convince me that the probe should never be resorted to except as a last resort.

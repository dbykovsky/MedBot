The spinothalamic tract is an anterolateral pathway. Since\u00a0it is on the same side of the body, a lesion on this side of the body will cause a deficit of anything controlled below that point. Several spinal cord syndromes have spinothalamic tract involvement. Spinothalamic tract deficit leads to loss of pain and temperature sensations on one side of the body at about two levels below the lesion but on the contralateral side. An example of spinal cord syndrome with such findings is Brown-Sequard syndrome, also known as a hemicord syndrome, which compromises multiple tracts of the spinal cord, including the spinothalamic tract. However, bilateral loss of pain and temperature in a dermatomal fashion can be present in syringomyelia where the anterior white commissure becomes obliterated due to cavitation in the central spinal cord.

Conservative management is usually the initially preferred modality of treatment for stable patients. Studies have demonstrated angiographic healing in more than 90% of the patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissection, usually within a month. [20] However, recurrent MI due to propagation of the dissection is not uncommon. A large-scale retrospective cohort study has shown that the recurrence rate is about 18%, and about half of the returning patients presented within the first week."}

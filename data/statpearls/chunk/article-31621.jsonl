Generally, a hyperbaric clinician should refer to the most up-to-date recommendations from the UHMS regarding optimal treatment paradigms that apply to the particular condition they are treating or to the guidelines at the individual clinician\u2019s specific practice location. Evidence suggests that HBOT is more effective when initiated earlier during the IRI, though specific treatment algorithms, such as those provided by UHMS, should be followed based on the specific clinical scenario.

Reperfusion after myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, organ transplantation, and compartment syndrome are all common clinical scenarios encountered in modern medical practice. Reperfusion may result in tissue injury worse than the original ischemic insult.

To enhance the process of administering HBOT, treatment teams can take specific steps before sending patients to an HBOT facility. Early communication with a hyperbaric team is critical to facilitate these steps. For instance, for patients with an endotracheal tube (ET) in place, filling the cuff of an ET tube with fluid instead of air may be necessary to prevent pressure-related complications in the HBOT chamber. An air-filled cuff can lose volume during chamber compression, leading to air leaks, improper endotracheal tube positioning, and compromised ventilation. Moreover, when patients require intravenous infusions and HBOT simultaneously, special pressure-rated tubing and pumps capable of withstanding the higher pressures of HBOT are necessary. Regular and early communication between the primary and hyperbaric teams can streamline care coordination, address the logistical aspects of hyperbaric treatment, and improve patient outcomes.", "contents": "Hyperbaric Treatment of Ischemia Reperfusion Injury -- Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions.

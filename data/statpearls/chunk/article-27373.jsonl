Decompression sickness may be prevented by gradual ascent. Other measures that can prevent this condition are avoiding alcohol before a dive or flight, spacing multiple dives or flights adequately, avoiding air transport after a long, deep-sea dive, and physical fitness.

Patients must also be advised to seek medical attention immediately for new or worsening symptoms, especially if trauma-related.

The condition may arise from traumatic and atraumatic causes and prehospital and in-hospital settings. If a patient is hemodynamically unstable and a tension pneumothorax is likely, needle decompression must be performed immediately, followed by CTT. If the patient is stable, diagnostic imaging like CXR can be obtained before treatment. Patients with pulmonary conditions predisposing them to high peak inspiratory pressures are at greater risk of tension pneumothorax. CTT suffices for managing most pneumothorax cases. Other surgical treatments like VATS with pleurodesis may be necessary in others. Quick diagnosis and management can prevent significant morbidity and mortality from this condition.", "contents": "Tension Pneumothorax -- Pearls and Other Issues.

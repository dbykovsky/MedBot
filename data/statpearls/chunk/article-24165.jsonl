This excludes patients with complex anatomy, such as excessive vessel tortuosity. A surgical repair usually relieves the obstruction with low mortality rates. Stent implantation decreases the risk of aneurysm formation and has good long-term outcomes in both native and recurrent coarctation. For discrete stenoses, balloon angioplasty can be used as a primary intervention, but it is not the best option for long-segment or tortuous forms of coarctation. [20] [21] [22]"}

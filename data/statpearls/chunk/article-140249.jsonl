Optometrists\u00a0and technicians help calculate the power of the intraocular lens accurately in the scenario of hazy corneas or corneas with sutures and uncooperative patients who are in severe pain due to inflammation and high IOP.", "contents": "Lens-Induced Inflammation -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes. Most patients with advanced cataracts who have phacogenic uveitis are elderly with co-morbidities. They need physician review to control diabetes, hypertension, and other systemic disorders. High intraocular pressure due to phacolytic glaucoma has to be controlled by antiglaucoma medications, including\u00a0systemic acetazolamide or intravenous mannitol, which needs monitoring by the nursing staff.\u00a0Options\u00a0for anesthesia\u00a0in cataract surgery include topical proparacaine, peribulbar lignocaine, sub-Tenon lignocaine, intracameral lignocaine, sedation, and general anesthesia. [59] Ocular inflammation due to lens-induced glaucoma causes severe ocular discomfort and pain. Perioperative pain relief and appropriate patient monitoring during surgery\u00a0may need to be managed by an anesthetist team.\u00a0Traumatic cataracts may happen more at a younger age. Cataract surgery is performed under general anesthesia with anesthetic agents that lower intraocular pressure. [60] Management of phacogenic uveitis needs teamwork with Ophthalmologists, nursing staff, and anesthetists. Optometrists\u00a0and technicians help calculate the power of the intraocular lens accurately in the scenario of hazy corneas or corneas with sutures and uncooperative patients who are in severe pain due to inflammation and high IOP."}

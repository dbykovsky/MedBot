The biliary tree in patients with APBJ likely continues to receive growth signals during the period before the duodenum recanalizes.", "contents": "Embryology, Pancreas -- Clinical Significance. Japanese investigators assembled the first clinical practice guidelines for patients with pancreaticobiliary maljunction in 2012. [32] As the first committee to address this condition, they defined it as an anomalous union occurring outside the duodenal wall, leading to reflux and accumulation of bile and pancreatic secretions. They distinguished between patients who develop common bile duct dilation and those who do not. The pathogenesis of this condition remains unclear, but they agreed on a hypothesis where the ventral pancreatic bud becomes dysplastic during embryogenesis. The mechanism for common bile duct dilatation is likely related to dysregulation between development in the duodenum and biliary tree. Normal duodenal development involves luminal obliteration and subsequent recanalization before birth. The biliary tree in patients with APBJ likely continues to receive growth signals during the period before the duodenum recanalizes."}

BPPV's pathophysiology involves the otoconia displacement that rests atop the otolithic membrane of the macule located in the utricle. Otoconia become displaced from the utricle to the semicircular canals, which leads to the unwanted perception of angular rotation of the head. BPPV is diagnosable with the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, which involves quickly moving a patient from an upright position to a horizontal position, with the head hanging over the side of the table and turned at a 45-degree angle. Reproduction of symptoms and the presence of nystagmus indicates a positive exam. Treatment for BPPV involves particle repositioning maneuvers, such as the Epley, Semont, and Lempert maneuvers."}

{"id": "article-864_28", "title": "Neuroanatomy, Ear -- Clinical Significance -- Tinnitus", "content": "Tinnitus is the unwanted perception of sound, often in the absence of external stimuli. The sound is described as ringing, buzzing, humming, or swooshing and can have a detrimental effect on a patient's quality of life. Tinnitus can be either objective or subjective. Objective tinnitus is audible by both the patient and clinician and is due to sound created by the flow of blood within vessels or of the contraction of a muscle in nearby structures. Causes include dural arteriovenous malformation, carotid bruits, venous bruits, carotid sinus fistulas, carotid dissections, and stapedial myoclonus. [22] Subjective tinnitus, which is much more common, can only be heard by the patient and often correlates with hearing loss. Presbycusis and otosclerosis seen in elderly patients can lead to the perception of subjective tinnitus. Another cause of subjective tinnitus is damage to the hair cells within the cochlea secondary to noise trauma or ototoxic medications. [23] Furthermore, tinnitus has been shown to have high comorbidity with psychiatric illnesses such as depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Treatment for tinnitus varies based on its underlying cause. When there is an identifiable cause of tinnitus, treatment focuses on the specific underlying etiology. However, with idiopathic tinnitus, treatment is aimed at mitigating triggers known to be associated with tinnitus. For example, patients with comorbid tinnitus and depression have benefited from cognitive behavior therapy and antidepressant therapy, but evidence for its efficacy is limited. Other treatments include addressing stress with cognitive behavioral therapy, implementing healthy sleep habits, and teaching patients strategies for coping with their symptoms. [24] Patients with associated hearing loss can benefit from hearing aids or cochlear implants. [25] Sound therapy has shown some efficacy in masking the perception of tinnitus and reducing the disturbance caused by tinnitus. Sound therapy involves playing a wideband sound through a generator placed around a patient's ears at a frequency similar to the patient's perceived tinnitus. Although many cases of tinnitus have no definitive treatment, patients can benefit significantly from implementing coping strategies to help mitigate symptoms.", "contents": "Neuroanatomy, Ear -- Clinical Significance -- Tinnitus.

Multiple animal toxicity studies, pre-marketing, and post-marketing of oseltamivir have indicated respiratory suppression resulting from central nervous system suppression, hypothermia, hypoactivity, and sudden death. This adverse event correlates with sudden-onset-type neuropsychiatric reactions in human patients (especially children from Japan), but no definitive link has been established. [33] The oseltamivir-induced liver injury\u00a0requires discontinuation of the drug and avoidance of reexposure.\u00a0Most patients recover\u00a0after discontinuation of oseltamivir\u00a0without specific\u00a0interventions.

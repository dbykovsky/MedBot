To make the diagnosis, different modalities\u00a0are used as\u00a0outlined above. Once the diagnostic tests are performed, cardiologists interpret them and clinically correlated based on history and physical examination. Radiologists read some imaging modalities such as cardiac MRI and nuclear stress tests. If the patient has multivessel coronary disease amenable to coronary bypass surgery, then cardiothoracic surgeons are involved. Post-intervention, the role of nurses, pharmacists, and patient-care facilitators is crucial; pharmacists will verify all prescribed drugs, check the dosing, and look for interactions, while nursing will perform administration and monitoring. Both pharmacists and nurses need to alert the clinicians of any issues they encounter, so therapy modification can take place if necessary. It is important the healthcare practitioners\u00a0have the\u00a0patient\u00a0on the right medication regimen, so a pharmacy consult is in order.

This drop in temperature can occur due to several factors, including prolonged exposure to cold environments, the physiological effects of shock, and alterations in metabolic processes. The onset of hypothermia in these patients is particularly concerning due to its impact on enzymatic reactions that are essential for physiological function. This disruption subsequently interferes with coagulation and cellular metabolism, resulting in a decreased ability to form clots and worsening acidosis.

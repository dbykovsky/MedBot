Decreased cardiac output is common immediately after a severe drowning event. [2] This reduction in blood pressure has the potential to lead to hypotension.

When crystalloid resuscitation has failed, further assessment of cardiac function and cardiac output with an echocardiogram is recommended to guide management further.

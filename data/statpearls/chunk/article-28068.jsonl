Vascular causes can then be subcategorized into arterial vs. venous, with arterial causes being more common. [4] Perhaps the most common cause of intermittent pulsatile tinnitus is uncontrolled hypertension, and appropriate management of this condition is paramount before proceeding with further interventions. Another common arterial cause is turbulent flow through arteries, various conditions can disrupt the laminar flow leading to turbulence, and it is this turbulent flow that patients can hear, causing pulsatile tinnitus. The most common etiology of pulsatile tinnitus is atherosclerotic carotid disease. Stenosis in the carotid arteries will cause turbulent flow through the carotids, which will be perceived by the patient as ipsilateral pulsatile tinnitus. Natural variation in the position of the basilar artery can similarly cause pulsatile tinnitus, even in a normotensive patient without atherosclerotic disease. Stenosis may also be due to more systemic disease such as fibromuscular dysplasia or Takayasu disease, though these are much rarer. Another vascular etiology is paragangliomas, also known as glomus tumors, of the jugular foramen and middle ear, or of the carotid body. This condition may is observable on otoscopy, and patients will usually present with\u00a0unilateral pulsatile tinnitus that is objectively heard on auscultation of the neck or ear by the examiner. The most common venous cause is idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also known as pseudotumor cerebri. These patients may have bilateral pulsatile tinnitus; this is most commonly seen in young, obese females who may also complain of vision changes and headaches. The proposed pathophysiology is that patients perceive rhythmic changes in cerebrospinal fluid pressure. The less common non-vascular etiologies include metabolic diseases causing increase cardiac output (such as pregnancy, anemia, and thyrotoxicosis) and myoclonus of palate and middle ear musculature.

Mohs and coined as chemosurgery. [2] Formerly, tumors were fixed with zinc chloride in situ . After\u00a01 day of fixation, the tumor was excised and histologically read for tumor clearance. If tumor burden was retained after initial excision, the process was repeated daily until pathologic clearance was attained. [3] [4] This process was time-consuming, involved serial visits over multiple days, and created a necrotic eschar at the excision site that did not allow for reconstruction. Modern MMS, popularized in the 1970s, utilizes fresh frozen section histology. This allows the entire procedure to be completed on the same day and avoids tissue damage to the defect site. As a result, Mohs defects can be repaired with various techniques ranging from linear closures to skin grafts and flaps on the same day as the Mohs procedure.

By minimizing tissue excision and optimizing wound closure, patient morbidity has been reduced with improved overall healthcare resource utilization. The emphasis on functional and cosmetic outcomes has enhanced patient satisfaction and improved psychological well-being and quality of life. Preservation of critical anatomical structures and minimizing functional impairments is paramount. This comprehensive approach exemplifies a paradigm shift in managing high-risk skin cancers, emphasizing tumor eradication and the preservation of patient quality of life and healthcare resources.", "contents": "Mohs Micrographic Surgery Design and Execution of Intermediate and Complex Closure  -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

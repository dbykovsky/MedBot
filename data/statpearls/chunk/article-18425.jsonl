In other practice settings, such as surgical clinics, BMI is often used to predict recovery time following surgery and calculate\u00a0the risk of a patient acquiring soft tissue infections and other post-surgical complications. While BMI can help aid in a patient's care, each provider\u00a0should aim to treat the patient, not the number. For example, if\u00a0a patient seems to have a\u00a0greater than average muscle content, it may be worth measuring body fat percentage and not treating based on BMI."}

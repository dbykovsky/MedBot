With regards to cardiac function, isoflurane has minimal impact on left ventricular function but does cause a dose-dependent decrease in systemic vascular resistance due to mild beta-adrenergic stimulation. This would lead to decreased cardiac preload and, in turn, decreased cardiac output, but a rise in heart rate mitigates the decrease in cardiac output.

Schwann cells are glial cells that play an important role in the peripheral nervous system including saltatory conduction of nerve impulses along axons, nerve development and regeneration, modulation of neuromuscular synaptic activity, and presentation of antigens to T lymphocytes. Demyelinating neuropathies include toxic, hereditary, and immune-mediated etiologies; the latter can be further be classified as acute and chronic depending on the onset.

Unfortunately, there are drawbacks to clear aligner treatment, including patient compliance and the severity of the case. Patients are instructed to wear clear aligners for at least 22 hours daily for an optimum time for the teeth to straighten. Additionally, if malocclusion cases are too severe, clear aligners are not recommended, and traditional braces are\u00a0usually\u00a0suggested. [26]"}

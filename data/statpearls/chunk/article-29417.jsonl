In a few patients, however, multiple microscopic examinations of pleural (pericardial) fluid are negative for tumor, and the fluid is non-bloody and not an exudate. When these elements and clinical judgment dictate that the effusion is not related to the tumor, the effusion should be excluded as a staging descriptor. e: This includes the involvement of a single distant (nonregional) lymph node.", "contents": "Squamous Cell Lung Cancer -- Staging. a: The uncommon superficial spreading tumor of any size with its invasive component limited to the bronchial wall, which may extend proximal to the main bronchus, is also classified as T1a. b: Solitary adenocarcinoma, \u22643 cm with a predominately lepidic pattern and \u22645 mm invasion in any focus. c: T2 tumors with these features are classified as T2a if \u22644 cm in greatest dimension or if the size cannot be determined, and T2b if >4 cm but \u22645\u00a0cm in greatest dimension. d: Most pleural (pericardial) effusions with lung cancer are due to tumors.

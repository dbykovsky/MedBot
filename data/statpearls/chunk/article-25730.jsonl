{"id": "article-25730_3", "title": "Radial Nerve Block -- Anatomy and Physiology", "content": "The radial nerve, along with the axillary artery, originates as a branch of the brachial plexus, specifically from the posterior cord of the plexus. The nerve is comprised of fibers from C5-T1 spinal roots. Proximally, the radial nerve is found posterior and inferior to the axillary artery. Once it exits the axilla, the nerve descends into the arm by passing anterior to the latissimus dorsi muscle insertion and then passes between the medial and long heads of the triceps muscle to eventually lie on the posterior surface of the humerus. The radial nerve has multiple branches, including the sensory posterior cutaneous branch of the forearm and the superficial radial nerve, as well as the motor deep radial nerve. The posterior cutaneous branch divides from the radial nerve proximal to the humeral lateral epicondyle, providing sensation to the elbow and the posterior forearm. Continuing distally, the radial nerve courses over the humeral spiral groove and emerges close to the lateral epicondyle. It subsequently pierces the lateral intermuscular septum to arrive at the anterior compartment of the arm, lying in-between the brachialis and brachioradialis muscles. Here, at the level of the antecubital fossa, it divides into its two terminal branches, the superficial and deep branches. The superficial branch is close to the radial artery, responsible for afferent innervation. This is a sensory branch, innervating the geographical area of the wrist dorsally and part of the thumb and index and middle fingers proximal to the DIP dorsally.

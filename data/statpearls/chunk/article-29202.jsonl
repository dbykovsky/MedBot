Studies show that patients with heart failure have a 40% lower concentration of total Na, K-ATPase. [21] One significant clinical application is in cardiovascular pharmacology. For example, ouabain is a cardiac glycoside that inhibits the Na+-K+ ATPase by binding to the K+ site. Other cardiac glycosides such as digoxin and digitoxin directly inhibit the Na+-K+ ATPase. [22] This inhibition causes a buildup of excessive K+ extracellularly, and accumulation of excessive Na+ intracellularly as the Na+-K+ ATPase can no longer pump K+ into the cell or pump Na+ out of the cell. This buildup of intracellular Na+ hinders the concentration gradient that usually drives the Na+/Ca 2+ channel exchanger, which generally\u00a0pumps Na+ into the cell and Ca 2+ out of the cell because the concentration gradient is not favorable for Na+ to enter the cell as excessive Na+ has built up intracellularly. This indirect inhibition of Na+/Ca 2+ exchange, therefore, causes a buildup of Ca 2+ intracellularly because the exchanger cannot allow Ca 2+ to exit the cell since it cannot accept Na+ into the cell. This increased intracellular Ca 2+ then increases cardiac contractility. This positive inotropy stimulates the vagus nerve, causing a decrease in heart rate. This physiology is clinically significant in the treatment of heart failure as it increases the contractility of the heart.

On MRI, severe hypoglycemia may present with restricted diffusion similar to that seen in CVA due to the similarity of their pathophysiology: hypoglycemia leads to insufficient brain cell energy reserves, resulting in the failure of active membrane ion pumps and therefore cytotoxic edema. [5] MRI changes secondary to hypoglycemia may cross several vascular territories, distinguishing them from those caused by cerebrovascular ischemia.

Evaluation of lid morphology:\u00a0Meibography using either a transillumination technique, in which the clinician everts the eyelid over a light source or an infrared video camera, to look for lid margin irregularities, pouting or plugging of the orifices, vascular engorgement, and changes in the mucocutaneous junction. [21] Note any evidence of eyelid thickening, dimpling, notching, pitting, tenderness, ridge formation between the meibomian glands, or distichiasis. [22] Meibography was first described by\u00a0Tapie in 1977,\u00a0using UV Wood's light to fluoresce the meibomian ducts on biomicroscopy and infrared light to illuminate the meibomian glands. [23] This imaging technique is helpful for direct in vivo visualization of the morphology of meibomian glands (see Image. MGD on Meibography). Meibography methods have evolved to include infrared meibography, visible light transillumination, laser confocal meibography, and optical coherence tomographic meibography. An example of one such system is the LipiView analyzer (Johnson and Johnson), which uses interferometry or specular reflection and allows high-resolution images of the lipid layer. [24] The average lipid layer thickness is 60 nm. A thin lipid layer is characteristic in patients with MGD and often corresponds to symptoms. Results of meibography are measured using the meiboscore, meibograde method, and Pult scale. The meiboscore for each eye's upper and lower lids is calculated separately and graded from 0 to 3; thus, a total score out of 6 is given for each eye. [25] The scoring is based on the following points: The lid has partial or missing glands The affected lid area is <33% The affected lid area is 33% to 66% The affected lid area is >66%"}

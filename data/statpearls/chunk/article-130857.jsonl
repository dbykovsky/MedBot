These areas include the spinal cord, brain stem and thalamus, limbic system, insular cortex, somatosensory cortex, motor cortex, and prefrontal cortex. [32] The signal that these areas of the central nervous system work together to create is responsible for allowing an individual to feel pain, and he referred to as the \u201cneurosignature.\u201d Furthermore, this theory states that input coming in from the periphery can initiate or influence the neurosignature, but these peripheral signals cannot create a neurosignature of their own.

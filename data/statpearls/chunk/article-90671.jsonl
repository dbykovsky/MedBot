Another concerning complication of deep CPB is subdural injection. Placing the needle too far can inadvertently penetrate the dural sleeve surrounding the nerve root, potentially resulting in a subarachnoid block leading to unconsciousness and hypotension. In such cases, endotracheal intubation and respiratory and cardiovascular support may become necessary."}

Additionally, unintentional deep injection or excessive local anesthetic volume can cause dysfunction and blockade of the recurrent laryngeal nerve, deep cervical plexus, and brachial plexus.

CPBs are simple to learn, and their indications are expanding as we know more about the applications of these blocks. Carotid endarterectomy remains the most common indication of a CPB. Other than carotid endarterectomy, there are many other procedures on the neck where this block can be utilized, including procedures like internal jugular venous cannulation, lymph node biopsies, lymph node dissection, plastic surgery, laceration repairs, incision and drainage of abscesses, and thyroid and parathyroid surgeries. The block is also finding its place in the emergency department for simple procedures for soft tissue and bone injuries, such as ear, neck, and clavicular region injuries, including fractures and dislocations. Recently, the use of this block has also been described for cervicogenic headaches.", "contents": "Cervical Plexus Block -- Clinical Significance.

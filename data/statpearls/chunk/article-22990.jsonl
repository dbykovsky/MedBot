It is intended to prevent infections in highly endemic areas with the worst burden of the disease. The vaccine elicits neutralizing antibodies that interfere with adult worms\u2019 survival in the gut and its ability to consume the host's blood.

{"id": "article-22990_38", "title": "Hookworm -- Pearls and Other Issues", "content": "Hookworm infections are currently considered one of the most underfunded neglected tropical diseases. Millions of people get infected with the parasite around the world, especially in poorer tropical countries. Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus are the main species that infect humans. A. ceylanicum , A. caninum , and A. braziliense are other minor causes. Hookworm infections are usually asymptomatic; symptoms vary depending on the stage of the life cycle, from cutaneous ground itch to respiratory symptoms until the main feature of iron deficiency anemia and, on rare occasions, intestinal bleeding. Diagnosis depends on both epidemiological, clinical, and microscopic evaluation. Management is mainly by either single-dose albendazole or multi-dose mebendazole. Mass treatment is useful in endemic areas. Health education and sanitation are the mainstays of preventing the disease. The vaccine is not available currently but under ongoing research and development.", "contents": "Hookworm -- Pearls and Other Issues.

Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion with careful history and examination, especially in non-endemic areas, besides a thorough analysis of stool samples from experienced histopathologists. Referrals might be necessary for both infectious disease specialists or gastroenterologists, and both have to be mindful of such a diagnosis for suggestive presentations.

Each cycle has\u00a03 phases: denaturation (approximately 95 degrees Celsius), annealing (about 55 degrees Celsius), and extension (about 72 degrees Celsius). The denaturation phase separates the template DNA molecule into\u00a02 single-stranded molecules. The\u00a0annealing phase is when the modified primer base pairs at the sequence of interest. Lastly, the extension phase extends the annealed primers according to the template strand.\u00a0The advantage of PCR is that it works more favorably\u00a0with different DNA templates (ie, single or double-stranded DNA and GC-rich regions) and produces millions of copies of a target gene. The disadvantage is there is less sequence fidelity (ie, thermostable polymerases are more error-prone than thermolabile polymerases). The\u00a0non-polymerase chain reaction technique  utilizes thermolabile DNA polymerases,\u00a01 primer, and a constant reaction temperature (eg, 37 degrees Celsius). The DNA template is denatured with an alkali solution or heat in this strategy. The template is annealed with the modified primer, and DNA synthesis occurs at 37 degrees Celsius. Though single or double-stranded DNA templates can be used, more favorable outcomes occur if a single-stranded DNA template is used (this increases the success of annealing). This process produces a hybrid DNA molecule (ie,\u00a01 template strand and\u00a01 newly synthesized mutant strand), which can be transformed or infected into E. coli . Once in E.coli , the mutant DNA and wild-type DNA can be segregated. Non-PCR has greater sequence fidelity than the PCR method; however, only 1 DNA strand is generated (rather than millions). [17]"}

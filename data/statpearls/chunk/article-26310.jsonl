Testes are two oval male reproductive organs situated in the scrotum. They are responsible for the production of male sex hormones and sperm.

The main arterial supply is by paired testicular artery, arising from the abdominal aorta, which passes via the inguinal canal inside the spermatic cord. Venous drainage is through the pampiniform plexus. As testis are originally retroperitoneal organs, lymphatic drainage is through para-aortic lymph nodes, while superficial inguinal lymph nodes drain the scrotum.", "contents": "Orchitis -- Introduction.

The latent period between drug exposure and the onset of renal failure could be\u00a0several weeks to months (e.g., NSAIDs) if the patient were naive to the medication. In contrast, a second exposure to the drug can lead to renal manifestations within a matter of a few days.\u00a0In a case series of 121 patients with AIN, 40% developed renal failure requiring dialysis. [33] Patients may remain asymptomatic or have non-specific symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, malaise, myalgia, fatigue, weight loss, anorexia, headache, skin rashes, arthralgias, and flank pain. [1] The other specific clinical features\u00a0may be related to the AIN's underlying etiology, such as sarcoidosis or SLE.

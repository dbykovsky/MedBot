The various prognosticating factors associated with an unfavorable prognosis include: Absence of visual potential confirmed on electrodiagnostic tests Severe disease Poor orbital volume Late age at presentation Avoidable cyst excision in < 7 years of age. Unless indicated, a cyst in a child of < 7 years should be left untouched owing to its contribution to orbital growth. Early lid surgery and socket reconstruction (pre-pubertal) Enucleation/Evisceration without orbital implants Discontinuation of expanders in early childhood/ Refusal to maintain the prosthesis Inability to maintain socket and prosthetic hygiene Infrequent follow-up visits"}

However, the associated cosmetic and functional disability can be minimized if appropriate measures are taken at every step. As opposed to the loss of an eye in adulthood, an early loss in childhood results in hypoplasia and volume loss of the affected orbit. It leads to distorted orbital-facial growth, rendering the management more challenging. Hence, an early presentation and a timely intervention are recommended to effectively manage these patients. Another issue is the loss of follow-up and the unwillingness of the parents to place a conformer/orbital expanders/prosthesis in the child\u2019s orbit.

[24]", "contents": "Overcoming Stigma and Bias in Obesity Management -- Clinical Significance. The disease model views obesity as a complex and chronic medical condition\u00a0rather than solely the\u00a0result of personal choices and behaviors. Diet and physical activity\u00a0play a significant role\u00a0and are influenced by genetic, environmental, and physiological factors.\u00a0Obesity is associated with metabolism and hormonal regulation alterations, challenging sustained weight loss. The disease model\u00a0promotes a medical approach to managing obesity, including lifestyle modifications, medications, and, in some cases, bariatric surgery. In the disease model, obesity\u00a0is considered a chronic condition requiring ongoing medical intervention\u00a0rather than\u00a0blaming the patient for unhealthy habits.\u00a0Recognizing\u00a0obesity as a chronic disease like hypertension, diabetes,\u00a0or asthma\u00a0enables clinicians to\u00a0care for patients more effectively. The\u00a0acceptance of this model by the medical community has\u00a0influenced approaches to treatment, public health strategies, and research. [24]"}

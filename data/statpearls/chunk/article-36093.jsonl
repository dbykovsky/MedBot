[21] There are multiple surgical approaches for scaphoid fixation, but minimally invasive percutaneous techniques are among the most popular. Kirschner wires are percutaneously driven through the fracture, and a cannulated screw is directed down the wire to provide fixation to the scaphoid. [21]"}

The scapholunate interosseous ligament plays a crucial role in wrist stability and injury to this structure can be challenging to diagnose. Patients typically complain of pain and wrist popping or clicking with wrist extension and grip. [22] Instability may be appreciable on radiography displaying the scaphoid in a relative position of palmar flexion and the lunate in a relative position of dorsiflexion. [22] Based on radiographic measurements a diagnosis of dorsal intercalated segmental instability can be made, which requires attention due to the possibility of it advancing to scapholunate advanced collapse (SLAC). SLAC leads to inappropriate dispersion of force across the wrist which can result in accelerated progression of wrist arthritis.

The collapse of the lunate will lead to proximal migration of the capitate. This altered alignment will result in abnormal scaphoid motion and ultimately arthrosis throughout the radiocarpal joint.

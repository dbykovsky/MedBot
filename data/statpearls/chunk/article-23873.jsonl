Keratosis pilaris is associated with many other conditions, including atopic dermatitis, ichthyosis vulgaris, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and malnutrition. It can also present in conjunction with syndromes such as Down syndrome and Noonan syndrome. [1] The condition often improves over time, but several treatment options are available. Emollients, exfoliants, antiinflammatory medications, phototherapy, and various laser therapies can treat keratosis pilaris. [2]", "contents": "Keratosis Pilaris -- Introduction.

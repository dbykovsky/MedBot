Ultrasound biomicroscopy: Unlike B-scan ultrasonography, UBM employs a higher frequency (ranging from 50 to 100 MHz), providing superior image resolution, albeit with limited tissue penetration. UBM proves invaluable in assessing iris cysts and distinguishing them from solid uveal tumors. By delineating the anatomical structures and relationships of the lesion, UBM facilitates accurate evaluation. [26] The cystic or solid structure of the iris or ciliary body lesion is differentiated using the UBM. UBM evaluates all margins of the iris cyst. UBM using 35 MHz may image the ciliary processes, the ciliary body, and the peripheral iris cysts.

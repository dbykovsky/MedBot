{"id": "article-21989_4", "title": "Fulvestrant -- Mechanism of Action", "content": "Fulvestrant is a novel drug that has shown to be of some use in the management of advanced breast cancer. It acts by binding, blocking, and degradation of estrogen receptors, which in turn leads to the complete cessation of estrogen signaling through the estrogen receptors in the body. [6] Fulvestrant acts as a complete antagonist at the estrogen receptor, compared with the previously used drugs, namely the selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), for example, tamoxifen, which had partial agonist activity. SERMs blocked the cellular E2 mediated activity of AF-2, which lead to inhibition of transcription downstream. However, they did not have enough AF-1 activity, which possibly leads to their partial agonist activity. Fulvestrant blocks both AF-1 and AF-2,\u00a0blocking the transcriptional activities of both downstream, and leaves no room for estrogen to exert its effects. Therefore, it is a complete antagonist at the estrogen receptor. [6]", "contents": "Fulvestrant -- Mechanism of Action.

Except for both column fractures, standard fracture reduction sequence is first to reduce and stabilize displaced column fractures and then reduce any wall fracture After definitive fixation of reduced fragments, entire construct stabilized with buttress plates For both column fractures, first reduce and stabilize one of the columns to the axial skeleton (iliac wing), then the other column, and later, if present, the wall component. The entire construct then gets stabilized with buttress plates Columns may be stabilized in young, healthy bone using screws alone; osteopenic bone and all wall fractures require buttress plating"}

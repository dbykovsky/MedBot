Conditions such as intestinal malrotation with midgut volvulus, internal hernia, congenital small left colon syndrome, Hirschsprung disease, meconium ileus, colonic atresia present with signs and symptoms of bowel obstruction similar to jejunoileal (JIA). Many patients with malrotation may be asymptomatic but are at increased risk of midgut volvulus. Volvulus can present at any age but are seen in 30% of children less than one month old. [40] Both volvulus and JIA presents with emesis, and malrotation is excluded using the upper gastrointestinal series. Most presentations of Hirschsprung\u2019s disease are seen during the neonatal period with signs and symptoms of intestinal obstruction or persistent abdominal obstruction following surgical anastomosis of small bowel at the JIA site. Contrast enema and rectal biopsy are utilized to exclude Hirschsprung disease from other causes of intestinal obstruction. In cystic fibrosis patients, meconium ileus is an important cause of intestinal obstruction similar in presentation to JIA. Like JIA, prenatal screening for cystic fibrosis and prenatal ultrasound findings with evidence of meconium ileus should trigger early workup and management to minimize complications associated with cystic fibrosis.

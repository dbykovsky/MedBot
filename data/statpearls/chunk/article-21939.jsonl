Computed tomography (CT) imaging has shown good sensitivity (88.5%) and specificity (93.3%) for Fournier gangrene. [54] It is the most sensitive and specific form of imaging in diagnosing Fournier gangrene. Typical findings include fat stranding around affected structures, subcutaneous emphysema, abscess formation, asymmetrical fascial thickening,\u00a0and abnormal fluid collections. [53] [55] [56] [57] [58] It is also useful in identifying the source of scrotal gas and excluding various intra- and retroperitoneal disease processes. [59] [60] CT scans are also recommended after surgery to identify new pockets of infection and to assess wound healing."}

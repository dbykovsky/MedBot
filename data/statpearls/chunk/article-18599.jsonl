Bilateral mammography 6 to 12 months after completing radiation therapy, followed by an annual screening mammogram and biannual breast exam, is the recommended procedure. [32] Routine use of annual contrast-enhanced MRI is generally not recommended except in high-risk patients such as those with familial/genetic risk of recurrence, dense breast tissue, and diagnosis under the age of 50. [32] This approach should not replace annual mammography but rather serve as an adjunct, often alternating with mammography for biannual imaging.", "contents": "Breast Cancer Conservation Therapy -- Clinical Significance.

The most important preoperative action is to obtain arm measurements of the affected side; this provides the healthcare team with a baseline for lymphedema monitoring. Patients often fear lymphedema. Arm measurement is critical to providers but also reassures the patient that they receive close observation to ensure quick action if postoperative swelling does occur.

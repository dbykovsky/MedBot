Examples of genital trauma may include childbirth, sexual abuse, and genitourinary surgery. Management for these patients tends to consist of lysis of the adhesion as well as applying topical estrogen cream. There have been cases of labial adhesion in the postpartum period. It is believed that a possibility may be due to breastfeeding along with the irritation and trauma that occurs during vaginal delivery. The reasoning behind breastfeeding as a cause is that when a mother breastfeeds her baby, prolactin is increased prolactin, leading to a decrease in estrogen and resulting in a hypoestrogenic state. Management remains the same. For preventive measures, it is recommended for minimization of vulvar irritation accompanied by adequate hygiene to the perineal area. Another recommendation may be for the resumption of sexual activity.", "contents": "Labial Adhesions -- Etiology.

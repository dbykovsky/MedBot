Hypoglycemia is the most frequent adverse effect of insulin therapy. It is important to educate people with diabetes and their partners about the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia, which include diaphoresis, tachycardia, lightheadedness, confusion, hunger, visual changes, and tremors. With a long duration of T1D, hypoglycemia unawareness becomes more common. Generally, 15 to 20 g of glucose should be given orally for blood glucose below 70 mg/dL. [17] Glucose readings should be rechecked 15 minutes later, with additional carbohydrates given if needed.d Once the glucose reading has normalized, if glucose readings again begin to fall, a snack should be given to prevent a recurrence.

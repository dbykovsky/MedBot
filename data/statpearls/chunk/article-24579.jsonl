Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a devastating, hyper-inflammatory condition that results in multi-organ failure and death. Primary HLH occurs in children as the result of genetic mutations and secondary HLH in adults after exposure to a strongly immunogenic stimulus such as infection, malignancy, or autoimmune disease. Diagnostic criteria have limited sensitivity/specificity. However, aggressive treatment is required urgently in order to obtain favorable outcomes. Given the myriad of presenting symptoms and multi-organ involvement, patients with HLH are often treated in quaternary hospital ICUs with multiple subspecialties involved in care. A high index of suspicion, as well as good interprofessional communication, is required to establish a diagnosis and initiate appropriate treatment in a timely manner."}

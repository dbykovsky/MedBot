Treatment for mild cases is frequently conservative, with\u00a0knee bracing and non-weight-bearing activities. However, surgery may be\u00a0indicated in some cases, eg, the \"unhappy triad of knee injuries\" from sports activities. This condition arises when the MCL ruptures and also tears the\u00a0medial meniscus and ACL due to\u00a0their firm attachment. [24]"}

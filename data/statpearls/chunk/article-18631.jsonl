It begins when a portion of the mesoderm, a transient structure known as the notochord, releases signals to the overlying ectoderm, called the neuroectoderm. This signaling causes the ectoderm to thicken into the neural plate, which will fold to create the neural tube. The neural tube further thickens to form the central nervous system, both the brain and spinal cord. The developing brain first forms three vesicles: the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. The forebrain, also known as the prosencephalon, further divides into the telencephalon and the diencephalon. It is from the dorsal telencephalon that the cerebral cortex arises, and that is where the Broca area will eventually come to be located.

Also known as expressive aphasia, it is non-fluent aphasia characterized by partially losing the ability to produce spoken and written language. Their speech will still contain important content, but they may omit articles, prepositions, and other words that only have grammatical significance. Thus, they are said to have \"telegraphic speech.\" The aphasia can vary in severity, and in some cases, patients may only be able to\u00a0speak in single-word sentences. In other words, these individuals know what they are trying to say, but they cannot say it. Patients will also lose the ability of repetition, as an intact Broca area, Wernicke's area, and arcuate fasciculus are required to repeat words or phrases. These patients do not entirely lose their ability to comprehend, but they\u00a0exhibit an increased effort of speech. This is because language comprehension is primarily a function of Wernicke's area, located in the posterior superior temporal gyrus. Therefore, they are typically aware of their deficits, and Broca aphasia patients are likely to become frustrated and often develop depression. It is also essential to differentiate dysphasia from dysarthria. Those with dysarthria have problems speaking because of an inability to move mouth and tongue musculature, while expressive aphasia is more issues with word-finding.

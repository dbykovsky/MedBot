Central precocious puberty (CPP) involves activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, which leads to early but normal pubertal development. CPP is more common in girls, and while most cases are idiopathic, it can be caused by neoplasm, radiation, head trauma, or genetic conditions. [14] Peripheral precocious puberty (PPP)\u00a0results from an increase in sex steroids that does not come from activation of the HPG axis. Findings in PPP patients typically include a rapid and atypically sequenced pubertal progression. The most notable causes of PPP include McCune-Albright syndrome and testotoxicosis. [15]"}

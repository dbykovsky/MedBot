Mediastinal nonseminomatous germ cell tumors : Chemotherapy is the first-line treatment for primary mediastinal nonseminomatous germ cell tumors. A combination of drugs is traditionally used, the most common being bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP), and standard therapy consists of 4 courses of BEP. Men with nonseminomatous primary mediastinal germ cell tumors have a worse prognosis of survival compared to men with mediastinal seminoma.

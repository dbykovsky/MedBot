Adapalene 0.1% and 0.3% have also been compared to tazarotene in multiple studies showing adapalene to be non-inferior in efficacy and demonstrated superior tolerability. [10] [19] The enhanced tolerability of adapalene has been attributed, in part, to the selective affinity to the nuclear RAR-beta and RAR-gamma receptors, as opposed to RAR-alpha. The decreased risk of skin irritation may contribute to better long-term compliance. Exposure to ultraviolet light should be minimized in patients using adapalene gel. Patients exposed to high levels of sun exposure and sensitive to sunlight should exercise caution. Using sunscreen and protective clothing over adapalene-treated areas is suggested when patients cannot avoid exposure to the sunlight. [4]"}

The differential diagnosis includes all conditions that cause an asymmetric bilateral chronic conjunctivitis with conjunctival cicatrization. These include Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, trachoma, \u00a0graft-versus-host disease, dry eye syndrome, history of adenoviral conjunctivitis, chemical burn, medicamentosa (from topical glaucoma medications and anti-viral medications for herpetic eye disease), atopic keratoconjunctivitis, radiation exposure, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Sjogren syndrome. A distinguishing clinical feature of OCP is a progressive symblepharon. [5] Symblephara from the above etiologies may form and then remain stable. However, a few conditions in which progressive cicatrization occur include neoplasia, lichen planus, and\u00a0paraneoplastic pemphigus. [5] [8]"}

It can be due to an axial length that is shorter than normal, corneal power that is too little, or lenticular power (optical power of the lens) that is too little. Of these, the most common cause is an axial length that is too short. [15]"}

In a similar fashion, contact lenses that give the cornea a steeper curvature increase the optical power of the cornea and are prescribed for hyperopia (Figure 7). As with myopia, procedures such as LASIK allow surgeons to use a laser to reconstruct the shape of the cornea, such that it can then converge light properly, just as it would when wearing contact lenses.

This results in an ability to see objects clearly at some distances but not at others. Most often, the lens ends up stagnant in its less spherical form, allowing for distant objects to be seen clearly but not close objects. This loss of the lens' ability to change shape is not considered pathologic but rather a normal aging process. [21] This is why many aging patients find themselves holding objects farther away from their eyes to read them and why many patients ultimately end up needing reading glasses.", "contents": "Concave And Convex Lenses -- Clinical Significance.

[22] The term \"meridian\" refers to any two-dimensional slice that can be taken through the cornea. Another common way to describe this is that if the cornea's anterior surface is visualized, astigmatism results when the cornea is more oval-shaped than circular. This means that the two-dimensional images reconstructed on the retina could be in focus in one dimension while remaining out of focus in another dimension. This can be corrected with glasses that have a cylindrical component to their shape instead of being perfectly spherical.", "contents": "Concave And Convex Lenses -- Clinical Significance.

Depending on the underlying malignancy, calvarial metastasis manifests as either a lytic or sclerotic lesion; occasionally, mixed lytic and sclerotic lesions are observed. Metastatic lesions of the skull are frequently multiple; however, a single metastatic lesion may also be present. [29] The radiological appearance of congenital calvarial defects could vary depending on the condition, such as the partial or complete absence of cranial vault bones, abnormal cerebral hemisphere development, incomplete medical parietal bone suture, delayed or incomplete ossification of the membranous parietal bone. Other possible diagnoses include an intradiploic arachnoid cyst. These are likely congenital and result from a restriction in the flow of cerebrospinal fluid from the arachnoid granulations into the veins. These cysts typically manifest as localized pain, swelling, seizures, or neurological deficits late in life. [14]", "contents": "Leptomeningeal Cyst -- Differential Diagnosis.

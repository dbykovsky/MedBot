[25] Similarly, necrotizing soft tissue infections and gas gangrene require emergent, extensive surgical debridement, and broad-spectrum, intravenous antimicrobial coverage to prevent rapid systemic decompensation. [1] [2] Osteomyelitis generally requires long-term intravenous antibiotic treatment, and in some cases, requires surgical debridement. Septic arthritis requires urgent irrigation and debridement in all cases to prevent inflammatory-mediated destruction of cartilage and the onset of arthritis. [1]"}

Provided the infection is promptly recognized, and appropriate antimicrobial coverage is initiated early, superficial infections typically resolve with good functional outcome. In cases of infections involving deep structures, the prognosis depends upon the chronicity of infection, the respective structures involved, and the adequacy of surgical and antimicrobial treatment. With deeper infections, postoperative care, and structured hand therapy are paramount to minimize tendon adhesions and digital stiffness. [2] Utilization of proper splinting techniques, which maintain the length of capsular ligaments and leave uninvolved joints free whenever possible, is also important to preserve function.

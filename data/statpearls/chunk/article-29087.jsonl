In 2013, FDA requested label changes and single-use packaging for OTC topical antiseptic products to reduce the risk of infection. Topical antiseptics are safe and effective agents for patient preoperative or preinjection skin preparation when appropriately used. To decrease the odds of patient infection, ensure these products are used according to the recommendations on the label.

This innovative approach, in turn, would reduce the risk of a serious allergic reaction, enhance clinical efficacy, and reduce the risk of irritation of current perioperative antiseptics. Hence a phase 3 trial was carried out.

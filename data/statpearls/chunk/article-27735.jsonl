This can be achieved by water deprivation or hypertonic saline infusion in a hospital setting with frequent monitoring of serum sodium levels. If the level of copeptin is 4.9 pmol/l or greater after stimulation, it is a diagnostic of primary polydipsia. [28]", "contents": "Primary Polydipsia -- Differential Diagnosis. The direct measurement of AVP was studied as well in the past. It was found that upon osmotic stimulation,\u00a0it provided great accuracy in differentiating primary polydipsia from diabetes insipidus, when compared to the water deprivation test, but did not gain a reputation in clinical practice. This is due to the limitations of the AVP measurement since it is not a stable peptide ex vivo. [25] The vasopressin precursor peptide has a stable c-terminal segment called copeptin, which can be used as a surrogate marker for vasopressin. [23] [26] [27] [28] A copeptin value of >21.4 pmol/l at baseline establishes the diagnosis of nephrogenic DI. If the value is less than 21.4 pmol/l, then osmotic stimulation to bring the serum sodium level to greater than 150 mmol/l is the next step. This can be achieved by water deprivation or hypertonic saline infusion in a hospital setting with frequent monitoring of serum sodium levels. If the level of copeptin is 4.9 pmol/l or greater after stimulation, it is a diagnostic of primary polydipsia. [28]"}

Given the cumbersomeness of the water deprivation test and the long duration involved with it, hypertonic saline infusion gained a reputation. Stimulation with hypertonic saline also requires frequent sodium checks and close monitoring. Keeping this in mind, a study was done with arginine infusion to measure the stimulated levels of copeptin instead of with hypertonic saline, which was promising. [29] More evidence is needed to substantiate this finding, though.", "contents": "Primary Polydipsia -- Differential Diagnosis.

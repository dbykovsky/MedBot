Some animal studies have shown that steroid use may be associated with abnormal placentation, which in turn causes fetal growth restriction. [18] The exact mechanism and association are still poorly understood. Risks and benefits must be factored into treatment strategies that involve long-term steroid use in pregnancy. Further research is needed to discern if there are any long-term effects on the children born to mothers who required treatment with corticosteroids during pregnancy, as well."}

For example, respirator fit testing can\u00a0be carried out at regular intervals (i.e., once a year), in partnership with the infection control committee (ICC) or an infection control nurse of a hospital facility. [30] [31] Production laboratories may seek the advice of laboratory staff in the application of biosafety measures when handling certain infectious agents or products. Clinicians may work with laboratory professionals, nurses, pharmacists, sanitary officers, among others, in coming up with organizational strategies as part of the healthcare-associated infection program in hospitals and medical facilities.From its current scope, biosafety has expanded to research facilities such as in animal research. [32] International conferences from various institutions still exist, which concentrate on sharing best practices and harmonizing biosafety guidelines at the regional, national, and global scale. [33] [34] Biosafety has been an emerging concern for occupational health. [35] Educational intervention on biosafety is highly essential so that staff can\u00a0be fully equipped with the correct knowledge of biosafety principles and can be able to\u00a0demonstrate\u00a0or enhance proper biosafety skills for\u00a0all healthcare workers. [36] [37] Therefore, the best practices for healthcare, research, and other institutions would always require a team commitment and cooperation to achieve a biologically \u201csafe and secure\u201d workplace and community.

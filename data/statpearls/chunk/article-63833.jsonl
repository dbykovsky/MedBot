These can be broken down into micro-skills, introducing each procedure component 1 at a time and building upon it with the next step until learners have reached a level of competency that represents mastery. [1] This process differs from traditional teaching in that no time limit is placed on learning the technique; a faculty member oversees the process and introduces any remediation necessary to achieve mastery. [8] When outlined, a simulation-based mastery learning curriculum focuses on the following: baseline testing, learning objectives that escalate in difficulty level, educational initiatives to meet the learning objectives, a competency level to meet or exceed, periodic formative assessment, a feedback loop, and ability to continually practice until achieving mastery. [9] The feedback loop should be planned out in advance based on the type (feedback versus true debriefing), source (self, peer, video, subject matter expert, simulator data), and timing (in-action, immediate, delayed). Faculty should also set the stage to highlight the selected debriefing process and provide feedback to maintain psychological safety.\u00a0 Feedback and debriefing can be an uncomfortable process.

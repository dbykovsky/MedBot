Patients with an increased risk of thrombosis such as pregnancy, obesity, oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), smoking, venous insufficiency, immunocompromised, diabetes, or hypertension are at risk for developing obstruction of the IVC and an increased risk of malignant neoplasm development. Education needs to be tailored more towards mobility, weight loss, dietary modification, smoking cessation, stop alcohol consumption, and a healthier lifestyle. [15]"}

It mimics a variety of\u00a0etiologies, and the signs and symptoms can overlap with other lethal conditions. So a prompt diagnosis can prevent significant morbidity and mortality. In addition to imaging, a thorough history and physical examination are vital to the diagnosis of IVCS. Although IVCS can predispose to thrombus formation, it protects against pulmonary embolism coming from the lower limbs deep vein thrombosis.

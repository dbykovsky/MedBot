Extra-spinal lesions of the sciatic nerve can confound the diagnosis of sciatic nerve lesions. [24] These extra-spinal lesions include piriformis syndrome, quadratus lumborum syndrome, osteitis ilii, and cluneal disorder. Thus according to some authors, the term deep gluteal space now incorporates the piriformis, even though other authors treat the piriformis as a separate entity. The boundaries of the deep gluteal space are as follows. [26]", "contents": "Anatomy, Abdomen and Pelvis: Inferior Gluteal Nerve -- Clinical Significance -- Deep Gluteal Space Syndrome.

The mechanism of endogenous\u00a0peptide and specific receptor binding is principally the design for peptides acting as imaging probes and receptor-binding peptides for overexpressed receptors such as in cancer proliferation. [29] These probes may be strategically designed\u00a0in vitro to mimic endogenous peptides that ultimately act as biomarkers and allow for the detection of a tumor. The implications of this advanced technology apply to the specific identification of tumor growth and even therapeutic purposes. With advancing sciences and molecular peptide chemistry and a better understanding of more effective targeting, these synthetic peptides have the potential to target multiple disease states with high specificity in imaging modalities such as\u00a0PET/SPECT, optical imaging, and MRI.

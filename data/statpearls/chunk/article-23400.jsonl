Please note that the J encoding regions of DNA in the heavy chain locus are distinct and not related to the J chain peptide associated with pentameric IgM secretion.

Expression of\u00a0the RAG1 (recombination-activating gene) and RAG2 genes is unique to developing B and T lymphocytes, and the proteins produced by these genes form the RAG complex (alternatively referred to as the VDJ recombinase), which catalyzes somatic recombination between\u00a0V, D, and J segments in a somewhat random manner.

Junctional diversity is an additional process utilized to increase the diverse repertoire of immunoglobulins made from the same relatively small genetic locus. It is associated with the random incorporation of nucleotides at the junctions between the V, D, and J segments.\u00a0For example, expression of the enzyme TdT (Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase) results in the random addition of nucleotides (N nucleotides) between the exon-encoding V, D, and J segments.

Although IgM is predominantly associated with the protection of the vasculature, IgM also has the ability to protect mucosal surfaces, although not normally to as great an extent as IgA. Both pentameric IgM and dimeric IgA can be transported across mucosal epithelial layers through the\u00a0polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (poly-Ig receptor). The poly-Ig receptor is located on the basolateral surface of mucosal epithelial layers and binds to either pentameric IgM or dimeric IgA through interaction with the J chain, resulting in transcytosis across the mucosal epithelial layer and release of the antibody from the apical surface. IgA is the predominant antibody used to protect mucosal surfaces such as the gut or lungs. Yet, mucosal IgM secretion also occurs and can be dramatically upregulated if IgA secretion is insufficient, which explains why many individuals with selective IgA deficiency do not suffer severe deleterious effects due to the increased secretion of other isotypes across mucosal surfaces such as IgM. The primary mechanism of antibody protection in the lumen of the gut or lungs is neutralization. Finally, IgM can serve as an opsonin, albeit not as powerful an opsonin as C3b, IgG1, or IgG3, and IgM appears to possess additional properties. IgM appears to facilitate the clearance of apoptotic cells and serve other immunomodulatory properties through two additional receptors for IgM, the Fc\u03bcR (FCMR) receptor specific for IgM (FCMR), and an Fc receptor that recognizes both IgM and IgA, Fc\u03b1/\u03bcR.

Therefore, the detection of IgM raised against a pathogen in a neonate indicates exposure to the pathogen by the neonate.

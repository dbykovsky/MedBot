Closure of the patent foramen ovale is also gaining recognition as a vital tool to prevent stroke recurrence. It has shown a clear superiority to antiplatelet therapy, and non-inferiority to anticoagulation. [10] Any patient who had a cardioembolic stroke less than 60 years old should evaluate for\u00a0patent foramen ovale. For patients with left ventricular thrombus and myocardial infarction, we usually recommend anticoagulation at least for three months due to embolization risk."}

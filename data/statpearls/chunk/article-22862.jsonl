The neurotransmitters involved in central processing include GABA, dopamine, and serotonin. Peripherally, they include acetylcholine, histamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine.\u00a0Classically, chlorpromazine had been the drug of choice for persistent hiccups and remains the only drug for hiccups approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Chlorpromazine acts as an antagonist on multiple central and peripheral neurotransmitter sites including dopamine, serotonin, histamine receptors, alpha-adrenergic receptors, and muscarinic receptors. [20] Due to the multiple sites of action, the drug may have significant side effects for some patients. Other typical antipsychotics, such as haloperidol or risperidone, have been tried with varying degrees of success. Often, the side effects of the typical antipsychotic drugs may be unbearable for the patient."}

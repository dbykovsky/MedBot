Breastfeeding considerations: Sulfasalazine and its active metabolite mesalamine exhibit limited excretion into breast milk. Sulfasalazine metabolite, sulfapyridine, is detected in both milk and infant serum, posing a potential risk of hemolysis, particularly in newborns and those with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. The highest risk of hemolysis in full-term newborns without G6PD deficiency is\u00a08 days post-birth. Most experts generally regard mesalamine derivatives as safe for breastfeeding. In situations where maternal sulfasalazine use is necessary, discontinuing breastfeeding is not typically warranted. However, close monitoring of breastfed infants for diarrhea is advised. Preferential consideration is given to mesalamine derivatives that lack a sulfonamide component. [35]"}

A thorough head and neck examination with neurologic evaluation is necessary to look for associated injuries and prevent complications. Noncontrast computed tomography scan of the maxillofacial bones is the gold standard imaging modality for these patients. Plain film x-rays, ultrasound, and MRI have less clinical utility in these patients. Physicians can wait up to two weeks to repair maxillary sinus fractures, allowing time to manage more life-threatening injuries. Isolated maxillary sinus fractures are typically treated with conservative management. Prophylactic antibiotic use for isolated MSFs is still controversial in the literature."}

The emergency response team and emergency department members will be necessary to identify any life-threatening injuries and stabilize the patient upon presentation. Surgical reconstruction may need to be carried out by the proper surgical teams, which could vary depending on any associated injuries and surgeon availability. One or multiple board-certified surgeons may be needed to treat these patients, which could include an otolaryngologist, facial trauma surgeon, oral maxillofacial surgeon, facial plastic surgeon, neurosurgeon, and/or ophthalmologist. The operating room (OR) staff, including surgical technicians and circulating nurses, will be imperative to keep the OR moving smoothly and improve surgical outcomes. An intensive care unit or critical care team made up of physicians, mid-level providers, nurses, and other staff may be needed to manage the patient medically, either pre- or postoperatively. Since these patients may be hospitalized for an extended amount of time, it is important for physical, occupational, and speech therapists to be involved in their care to improve long-term outcomes.", "contents": "Maxillary Sinus Fracture -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

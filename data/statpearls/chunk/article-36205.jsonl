Immediately after birth, the only means for the neonate to rid itself of excess bilirubin is through its own liver, which functions poorly for the first week or so of life and is incapable of conjugating significant quantities of bilirubin with glucuronic acid for excretion into the bile. Approximately 60% of term and 80% of preterm infants develop what is known as \"physiologic jaundice\" in the first 1-2 weeks after birth, which includes yellowing the skin, sclera, and mucous membranes.\u00a0Physiologic jaundice\u00a0appears after the first\u00a024\u00a0hours of life, is characterized by a peak bilirubin concentration < 15 mg/dL, and is typically a mild, self-limiting condition that resolves without treatment.

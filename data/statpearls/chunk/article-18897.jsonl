SV is the other major determinant of cardiac output and is also affected by several factors. The amount of blood ejected each beat depends on preload, contractility, and afterload. Preload represents all of the factors that contribute to passive muscle tension in the muscles at rest. [7] Preload is\u00a0proportional to the end-diastolic ventricular volume, or the amount of blood in the ventricles immediately before systole. Greater end-diastolic volumes of blood returned to the heart, increase the passive stretching of the heart muscles. This in turn results in the ventricles contracting with more force- a phenomenon called the Frank-Starling law of the heart. [8] Contractility describes the force of myocyte contraction, also referred to as inotropy. As the force of contraction increases,\u00a0the heart is able to push more blood out of the heart, and thus increases the stroke volume. The final determinant of stroke volume is afterload. Afterload represents all the factors that contribute to total tension during isotonic contraction.

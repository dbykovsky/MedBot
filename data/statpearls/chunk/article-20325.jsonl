The American Geriatrics Society has supported the\u00a0Hospital Elder Life Program (HELP), which has been shown to reduce the incidence of delirium in elderly patients. This is an interdisciplinary program with many components. Interventions include decreasing environmental disturbances and prioritizing uninterrupted sleep. During the day, guidelines encourage the use of eyeglasses or hearing\u00a0aids to optimize\u00a0hearing and vision, the use of tools to improve orientation, including clocks, calendars to remind individuals where they\u00a0are, early morning rise times, and adequate fluid intake. It supports frequent mobilization and reduction in \"tethers\" such as urinary catheters or IV lines that limit mobility. Therapeutic activities such as music therapy are encouraged when appropriate. It is known these strategies are cost-effective and remain the primary\u00a0treatment for delirium. The HELP program has also been shown to reduce the rate of falls by 42% and reduce hospital costs per patient by $1600\u00a0to $3800 (2018 U.S. dollars)\u00a0and over\u00a0$16,000 (2018 U.S. dollars) per person-year of long-term care costs in the year following a delirium episode.

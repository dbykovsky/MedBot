The resting membrane potential in myocytes is about -85 mV, and with the influx of sodium ions, depolarization occurs (membrane becomes more positive -45 to -30 mV) and thus generating an action potential that is potentiated by L-type calcium channels. These voltage-gated channels are targeted with cardioplegia to induce cardiac arrest. [2] The persistence of potassium reduces the membrane potential and does not allow for adequate repolarization.

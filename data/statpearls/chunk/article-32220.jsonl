The osseous anatomy of the femoroacetabular articulation contributes to the hip\u2019s inherent stability. The pelvis is made up of three parts: the ilium, ischium, and pubis. These innominate bones come together at the triradiate cartilage to form the cup-shaped socket known as the acetabulum. At 15 to 17 years of age, the triradiate cartilage begins to ossify, and it completely fuses by 20 to 25 years of age. Acetabular development is a complex process that involves both endochondral growth from the triradiate cartilage and intramembranous growth from primary and secondary ossification centers of the innominate bones. [2] The acetabulum covers approximately 40% of the femoral head at any position of hip motion. Additional stability is conferred by the labrum, a rim composed of circumferential collagen fibers that surrounds the acetabulum and acts to deepen the hip socket and limit the extreme range of motion. The acetabular labrum contributes approximately 22% of the articulating surface of the hip and increases the volume of the acetabulum by 33%.

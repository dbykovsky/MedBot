Minimization of skin incisions assists with decreasing finger edema and potential adhesion formation.

Once such, the Saint John Protocol, describes a regimen of up to one-half fist of protected true active finger flexion initiated 3\u00a0to 5 days following flexor tendon repair. Waiting 3\u00a0to 5 days before movement allows the swelling, work of flexion, and friction to decrease, thus minimizing the risk of rupture. [22] The protocol then proceeds through \u201cwarm up\u201d passive flexion of all digits before advancing to active flexion. Active IP joint extension while in MP flexion block prevents IP joint flexion contracture. True active flexion up to one-third to one-half a fist is established throughout day 4 to week 2. From 2\u00a0to 4 weeks, patients are engaged in an active synergistic exercise program, working towards half to full active fist position with 45 degrees of wrist extension while continuing IP joint extension.

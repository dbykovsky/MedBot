Mitochondrial cytopathy syndromes: It is a condition where the mitochondrial DNA is abnormal; this might interfere with the function of mitochondria in particular and the function of the cell in general. It is caused either because of nuclear DNA-mutations or mutation within the maternally inherited form of the mitochondrial genome. Even though the symptoms vary widely, they can present in the\u00a0way of muscle weakness, high levels of lactic acid, and even degenerative lesions of the brain. Diagnosis is by examining the biopsies taken from the muscle cells under an electron microscope.

Nearly all antibacterial agents have been linked to Clostridium difficile\u2013 associated diarrhea (CDAD), including penicillin, with severity ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Antibacterial agents alter the colon's normal flora, causing the overgrowth of C difficile . This strain produces toxins A and B that contribute to the development of CDAD. During infections caused by hypertoxin-producing strains of C difficile , the morbidity and mortality rate is\u00a0increased since these infections are often resistant to antimicrobial treatments and may require colectomy. Antibiotic treatment is recommended when CDAD is suspected or confirmed. Depending on clinical need, protein supplementation, fluid and electrolyte management, antibiotic treatment, and surgical evaluation\u00a0are implemented. [37]"}

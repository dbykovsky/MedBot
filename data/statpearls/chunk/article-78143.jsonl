Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has become increasingly common for patients with cardiac failure, respiratory failure, or a combination of both. This development is evidenced by the growing number of centers offering ECMO as a therapy. [5] In pediatrics, the American Heart Association recommends ECMO as a consideration in patients with refractory cardiac arrest with a potentially reversible etiology. [6] ECMO is a method of supporting the cardiorespiratory system by mechanical means. Its use has been heavily described in the pediatric medical world and is now growing in popularity in the adult medical world. ECMO can support cardiac and respiratory support utilizing cannulae placed in large venous and arterial vessels in the body that bypasses the blood via a circuit with an oxygenator and a means to remove carbon dioxide. The newly oxygenated blood is circulated back to the patient through the arterial cannula. ECMO can also provide respiratory support through a specialized cannula inserted into one of the vena cava that can divert venous return through the ECMO circuit, where it will be oxygenated and returned through the same cannula in a different lumen towards the patient\u2019s right heart. The former method is referred to as veno-arterial ECMO, and the latter is venovenous ECMO.

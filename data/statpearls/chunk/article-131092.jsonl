Chronic malabsorption and blood loss lead to iron deficiency anemia and vitamin deficiency anemias. The chronic inflammation within the intestine may lead to strictures and fistulas that occur more commonly with Crohn disease. Perianal fistulas are most common. However, entero-enteric, entero-cutaneous, entero-vesical, or entero-vaginal fistulas may also occur. Ulcerative colitis predisposes to the risk of toxic megacolon, colonic perforation, and colonic carcinoma. PSC is a progressive disease that eventually leads to cirrhosis and hepatic failure if left untreated. Chronic inflammation-induced hypercoagulable state predisposes to deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Chronic inflammation, malnutrition, and treatment therapies may lead to osteopenia, osteoporosis, growth failure, amyloidosis, and fatty liver disease.", "contents": "Extraintestinal Manifestations of Inflammatory Bowel Disease -- Complications.

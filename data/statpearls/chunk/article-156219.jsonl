Silicone:\u00a0These implants are nonporous\u00a0and may\u00a0be\u00a0composed of solid silicone or dimethylsiloxane subunits. Nonporous implants do not allow tissue ingrowth and become encapsulated, thus requiring fixation to the underlying bone for immobilization.\u00a0Implant fixation can reduce the dead space between the implant and bone, reducing the chance of tissue ingrowth and seroma formation. Fixation also limits bony resorption, migration, and unaesthetic results. [22] Autogenous implant:\u00a0Autograft use in cosmetic augmentation is limited due to bony resorption unpredictability. One reason is that autograft bone must be under stress to prevent resorption, an example of Wolff's Law. This law states that bone will adapt and remodel to withstand stress.\u00a0Thus, minimal impact on implant sites leads to decreased bone density\u00a0due to the absence of stimulation.

For chin implants, active engagement of the mentalis muscle, which strains to compensate for weakness, increases pressure on the underlying implant.

Less invasive procedures generally reduce costs using inexpensive hardware and anesthetic alternatives and incur less surgical time. Facial implant procedures are routinely performed under general anesthesia and intravenous sedation. However, awake implant placements under local anesthesia may also be performed. A 2014 UCLA research revealed that operating room costs could reach $35 per minute. [36] Alternative anesthetics reduce general anesthetic risk and monetary constraints for individuals who want to undergo facial implant surgery but have health and monetary restrictions. Patient recovery after implant placement is based on soft-tissue healing and requires only a few weeks. In contrast, bony surgery requires a significantly longer period to be considered stable.", "contents": "Facial Implants -- Clinical Significance.

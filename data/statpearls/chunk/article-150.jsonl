An operator is required for the invasive procedure and another one for the operation of the recording system and the external stimulator. The care of the patient (monitoring of vital signs, administration of oxygen, and intravenous medications) is the responsibility of the nursing staff. Nurses can also help with the setup of the examination and have a critical role in the early diagnosis and treatment of complications. Moreover, they can play a significant role\u00a0in post-procedural care, and the long-term follow up of the arrhythmia patient.

The most significant factor affecting a patient's risk of regret is their age, with the risk of regret decreasing with advancing age. The average probability of regret for individuals sterilized before age 30 is estimated to be between 12% and 20%, with higher rates in younger individuals. The CREST study noted rates of regret as high as 40% in people sterilized between the ages of 18 and 24 years. Those sterilized after age 30 are estimated to have only about a 6% risk of regret.

Immunocompromised patients and adults have\u00a0been noted to shed HPIV-1, HPIV-2, and HPIV-3 for many months. [3] Viral culture:\u00a0Considered for years to be the gold standard for diagnosis. The detection of hemadsorption (HAD) to the monolayers or the development of structural changes in host cells called cytopathic effect (CPE), the existence of either one of them is significantly important for viral isolation on the cell culture. [1] The hemadsorption and the CPE\u00a0can be confirmed by the use of the fluorescent-labeled monoclonal antibodies (Mab) that are viral-specific. [1] Viral culture is rarely used as it is time-consuming and\u00a0takes much more time for the results to be available. [2]"}

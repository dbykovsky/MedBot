Tizanidine is also used off-label for managing patients suffering from chronic neck and back pain and chronic migraines.\u00a0However, this drug can cause hypotension, bradycardia, and hepatotoxicity.

In addition, the neurologist should evaluate the improvement in spasticity related to neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis, stroke, and spinal cord injury. Nurses can check compliance, monitor for adverse events, and counsel patients for adherence to therapy. The pharmacist should verify the dosing regimen, perform medication reconciliation for drug interactions, and counsel the patient on adverse drug reactions. In addition, patients need to be warned not to combine it with antihypertensive medications. In the overdose of tizanidine, triage nurses should admit the patient, and the emergency department physicians should monitor blood pressure and heart rate and obtain 12 lead EKG. Additionally, a liver function test is required to assess for hepatotoxicity. The critical care physician should manage severe overdose, which requires vasopressors and fluids during the ICU stay.", "contents": "Tizanidine -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

Caution: Physicians who order germline tests are ultimately responsible for discussing the results with their patients and arranging for genetic counseling if appropriate. This extra burden on physicians, as well as a general lack of knowledge about germline testing, result interpretation, how to counsel patients, the need for outside laboratory resources for the actual testing, questions about insurance coverage, and the lack of genetic counselors, are all impediments to the more widespread and effective use of germline testing."}

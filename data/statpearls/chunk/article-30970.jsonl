A conventional vaporizer would need a flow of 73 L/min to deliver a concentration of 1% desflurane to the patient, in contrast to the 5 L/min or less that is needed for other halogenated drugs. Second, desflurane boils at almost room temperature (22.8\u00baC), losing heat in absence of temperature compensation. However, temperatures may vary in different operating rooms. Intermittent boiling will result in large fluctuations of anesthetic gas delivery due to unpredictable saturated vapor pressure.

These vaporizers have two independent gas circuits aligned in parallel. The fresh gas circuit passes through a fixed restrictor and leaves the vaporizer through the common gas outlet. The anesthetic gas circuit is originated in the sump, which works as a desflurane vapor reservoir. The sump is heated at 39\u00baC, a temperature that exceeds the boiling point of desflurane and generates up to 1300 mmHg of vapor pressure (2 atm). Downstream from the sump, there is a shut-off valve that opens once the vaporizer warms up, and the concentration dial is open. Downstream from the shut-off valve, there is a variable restrictor that can be controlled by the user and adjust the concentration of anesthetic gas. Both circuits finally join before leaving the vaporizer together form one flow to the patient. Despite the fact that these circuits are physically separated, they are interconnected electronically through a differential pressure transducer, a pressure-regulating valve, and a control electronic system. The backpressure generated by the pass of the fresh gas flow through the fix restrictor is proportional to the flow rate that is sensed by the differential pressure transducer. The difference of pressures between the fresh gas flow circuit and the desflurane circuit is calculated and transmitted to the control electronic system. This system tunes the pressure regulating valve equalizing the pressure of the two circuits. This equalized pressure is known as working pressure, which is constant at an FGF rate.", "contents": "Anesthesia Vaporizers -- Equipment -- Mode of Operation.

[2]", "contents": "Anthropometric Measurement -- Clinical Significance. Although technology may eventually advance to replace anthropometry on some level, one study found that the anthropometric measures of waist and hip circumferences are superior to ultrasound in assessing regional adiposity. [16] A study from Sweden showed the association of\u00a0anthropometrics with chronic medical conditions, measuring anthropometric measurements relative to underlying conditions such as myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, stroke,\u00a0cognitive impairment, and dementia. [2] It noted that participants with myocardial infarctions had\u00a0significantly higher weight, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio, indicating a higher subcutaneous and central adiposity prevalence. A high\u00a0skinfold measurement was noted to be a strong indicator or\u00a0predisposing risk factor for congestive heart failure in the study. Patients with cognitive impairment had a lower weight, and those with dementia were noted to have lower weight as well as lower skinfold measurements. [2]"}

In pediatric populations, it is an essential tool to detect metabolic and developmental abnormalities early on so that they may be addressed efficiently. In the adult population, they can be used to diagnose the severity of illnesses such as obesity and cognitive impairments and help follow patients over time to assess for improvement after treatment. Although an inherent measurement error exists, it can be minimized by using well-calibrated tools and training. To enhance long-term patient outcomes, an interprofessional team of nurses,\u00a0nurse practitioners, physician\u00a0assistants, and clinicians should work together to obtain reproducible results that apply to clinical settings consistently. This\u00a0can help identify at-risk individuals early and help clinicians promote a healthy lifestyle for at-risk patients to avoid the well-documented adverse effects of obesity and malnutrition.", "contents": "Anthropometric Measurement -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

Pain is commonly associated with this procedure even when an adequate penile block is performed. Phenylephrine\u00a0is an\u00a0alpha-adrenergic\u00a0agonist that can cause\u00a0headaches, dizziness, blurry vision,\u00a0hypertension, bradycardia,\u00a0tachycardia,\u00a0and\u00a0irregular cardiac rhythms. Because of these risks, the patient\u2019s vitals need to be closely monitored, and the dosage of\u00a0phenylephrine should be limited\u00a0to 1000 micrograms in 1 hour.\u00a0Recurrence\u00a0is possible\u00a0and is an indication that\u00a0the\u00a0patient\u00a0may\u00a0require\u00a0a more invasive procedure."}

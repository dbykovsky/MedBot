A Cochrane review of 30 randomized controlled trials demonstrated no statistically significant improvement in oxygen saturation, rate of hospitalization, duration of hospitalization, or time to resolution of illness with the use of bronchodilators in the setting of bronchiolitis. [14] Clinical score improvement with bronchodilators was statistically significant in the outpatient setting; however, the clinical significance came into question due to the small degree of change observed. [14] In contrast, the inpatient population showed no improvement in the mean clinical score. [14] In a small study of 22 mechanically ventilated infants with respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis, bronchodilators caused a small but statistically significant fall in peak inspiratory pressures. [15] The authors noted the effects were minute and unlikely to be clinically significant, while the statistically significant tachycardia (from the bronchodilators) had greater potential to be clinically significant.

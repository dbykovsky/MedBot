The proximity of the transvaginal ultrasound probe to the regions of interest allows for better image quality than its transabdominal counterpart. [4] It operates with a higher frequency transducer (5\u00a0to 7.5 MHz), resulting in less artifact. A higher frequency can only penetrate so much through tissue, making it ideal in the transvaginal route. [20] Additionally, there is marked difficulty in obtaining proper transabdominal sonographic images in an obese patient because of the amount of soft tissue the sound waves need to traverse; the transvaginal probe bypasses the pannus.

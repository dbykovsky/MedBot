The ERA is a molecular diagnostic tool used to identify a receptive endometrium via a specific transcriptomic signature present in both natural and hormone replacement therapy cycles. The technology has been applied clinically to identify a patient-specific window of implantation, which is then used to guide a personalized timing of embryo transfer for patients with recurrent implantation failure. This is done by taking an endometrial biopsy at specific times during the mid-luteal phase (LH surge+7 days in natural cycles, progesterone starts +5 days in hormone replacement/\u201dartificial\u201d cycles. The results of the ERA are then used to guide shifts in the timing of progesterone administration before embryo transfer in a future cycle. Most data evaluating ERA-timed embryo transfers and associated pregnancy rates have failed to see an improvement in the live birth rate in these cycles. [33] [34] Most recently, a 2022 RCT by Doyle et al. evaluated live birth after standard vs. ERA-timed euploid embryo transfer and found no difference in the live birth rates. [35] However, the study designs of these investigations have been heavily critiqued, bringing the validity of their findings into question."}

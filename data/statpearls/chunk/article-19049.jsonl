B. suis (agent US), B. melitensis (agent AM),\u00a0and B. abortus (agent AB) were all researched by the United States for its biological warfare program; however, their lethality of less than 5%\u00a0made them less than ideal for military leaders who were seeking lethal agents. Brucella is easily aerosolized and survives well after aerosolization. In the event of a biological attack or a laboratory accident involving a Brucella species, treatment with one of the antibiotic regimens mentioned above should be considered. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not generally recommended for exposure to endemic Brucella species, and prevention is best achieved by wearing appropriate protection when working with infected animals, adequately cooking meat products, and pasteurization of dairy products.

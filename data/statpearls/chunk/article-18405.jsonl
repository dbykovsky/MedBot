The kidney's primary function is to modify the solutes and water content of the blood through filtration, reabsorption, and secretion. As blood passes through the glomerulus of the kidney, solutes and water are filtered out depending on a variety of signaling molecules. Then, as the filtrate passes through the tubules, some filtrates are reabsorbed along with water. The amount of water and solute reabsorbed is what primarily regulates blood volume. If blood volume is too low, more filtrate reabsorbs; if blood volume is too high, less filtrate\u00a0reabsorbs. The kidney is also responsible for the secretion of erythropoietin.

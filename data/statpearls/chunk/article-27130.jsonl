In addition to bleeding complications, in patients who are undergoing CDT or PMT, there is also a risk for pulmonary embolus. Lysis can cause clot fragmentation, and manipulating wires within the veins may dislodge the thrombus. Given this concern, consideration should be made for placing an IVC filter in select patients with extensive burden that extends into the IVC. Recently, a randomized controlled trial FILTER-PEVI (Filter Implantation To Lower Thromboembolic Risk in Percutaneous Endovascular Intervention) demonstrated an eightfold increase in symptomatic iatrogenic pulmonary embolism in patients who did not receive a filter before intervention. However, mortality was no different in those without a filter compared to subjects who had a filter placed. [18]"}

Venous thrombectomy in the form of open exposure followed by passing a Fogarty balloon catheter proximal and distal was historically performed.

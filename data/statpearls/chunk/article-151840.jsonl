Implantation is typically performed at the bulbar urethra but can also be done at the bladder neck, albeit with some added difficulty. The bladder neck is theoretically the superior location for a compression cuff as there is thick, muscular, well-vascularized tissue in this area. However, following prostate surgery or radiation, the\u00a0area surrounding the bladder neck becomes scarred, fibrous, and fixed to the surrounding structures, with a somewhat compromised blood supply\u00a0leading to poorer healing.

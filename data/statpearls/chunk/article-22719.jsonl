The procedure of choice is microvascular decompression, which entails releasing the facial nerve from the compression of the aberrant vessel at the root exit zone of the brainstem. As discussed earlier in electrophysiological findings, the lateral spreading response results from the ephaptic transmission of nerve signals to neighboring neurons due to compression-related demyelination of the facial nerve root at the exit/entry zone. When such compression is relieved, the lateral spreading response on nerve stimulation will disappear. A high-resolution 3D time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiogram with high-resolution T2-weighted imaging may improve the visualization of the aberrant vessel preoperatively. [13] Following the first year after surgery, the average success rate of microvascular decompression surgery is reported to be 80% to 88%.

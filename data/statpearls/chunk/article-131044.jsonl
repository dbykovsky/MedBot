Treatment involves medical management with prolonged antifungal therapy and consideration of surgery. Potential treatments include potassium iodide (KI), cotrimoxazole, amphotericin B, imidazoles, and hyperbaric oxygen, each with varying success rates. The standard treatment typically involves\u00a0KI and triazoles, particularly itraconazole. Due to relative resistance to antifungals, higher doses than standard are necessary for adequate treatment, and prolonged daily therapy spanning several months is recommended. [15] Monotherapy is typically not successful. Interestingly, in vitro studies indicate that entomophthoralean fungi display resistance to\u00a0KI. Researchers suspect that KI works in vivo through fungal cell wall degeneration and the activation of an immunological response."}

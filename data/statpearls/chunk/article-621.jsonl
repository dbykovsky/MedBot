After preparing the chest and exposing all relevant areas, attention is directed to the groin. A groin cutdown is performed just below the inguinal ligament, utilizing a prolene suture (4-0, 5-0, or 6-0) for pursestring placement to facilitate the insertion of arterial or venous cannulas into the femoral vessels. Full heparinization is then achieved with an appropriate activating clotting time. Under TEE guidance, wires are inserted. Arterial femoral artery cannulation is carried out using a 17 Fr or 19 Fr cannula."}

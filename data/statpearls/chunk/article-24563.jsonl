The lymphatic vessels reabsorb interstitial fluid from the periphery to return it to the intravascular space, which prevents fluid build up in peripheral tissues. The lymphatics allow for the immune system to function properly as it carries antigens to lymph nodes, and also carries immune cells, such as macrophages to sites of infection to begin the immune process.

The initial point of entry into the lymphatic system is through the capillaries, which are a single layer of partially overlapping endothelial cells creating a valve. These overlapping junctions form a \"button-like\" opening, which allows fluid into the capillary when the pressure outside of the vessel is greater than the pressure inside of the vessel. The capillaries subsequently feed fluid into the collecting vessels, in which an endothelial layer with many tight junctions forms a \"zipper-like\" structure. These collecting vessels also have intraluminal valves as well as pericytes. The pericytes contain alpha-smooth muscle actin, which functions to contract the vessel and pump the fluid further through the system. The valves prevent the backflow of the lymphatic fluid and ensure the unidirectional flow of fluid. [2]", "contents": "Physiology, Lymphatic System -- Cellular Level.

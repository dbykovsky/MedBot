The hypothalamus participates in other functions such as body temperature regulation, appetite and weight, childbirth, growth, breast milk production, sleep-wake cycle, sex drive, and even emotions and behavior. Because of this wide variety of physiologic roles, a lesion or disease of the hypothalamus can produce different signs and symptoms, depending on the particular affected area.", "contents": "Hypothalamic Dysfunction -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

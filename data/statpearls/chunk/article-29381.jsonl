Nonoperative management with splenic arteriography and angioembolization has been increasingly used. [18] Angiography and embolization are commonly used in treating vascular injuries affecting the liver and spleen in adults. Previously, prophylactic embolization was not recommended for stable patients who show an arterial blush on CT. [19] According to the 2022 World Society of Emergency Surgery consensus document, splenic artery embolization is currently recommended as the primary intervention in hemodynamically stable patients presenting with arterial blush on CT scans, irrespective of injury severity. [20] However, their application in the pediatric population is primarily restricted to isolated case reports and series. Limited evidence suggests that angiography may serve as a viable alternative to surgery in hemodynamically unstable children with blunt liver or spleen injury demonstrating an arterial blush on CT imaging."}

In many cases, pediatric traumas are managed in hospitals where adult trauma surgeons provide care to patients.

The threshold for considering splenectomy should be reduced in patients with multiple traumas or those experiencing physiological instability, including coagulopathy.

Patients at the highest risk of this complication are the immunocompromised, such as very young patients, those receiving chemotherapy. Additionally, the patients receiving blood products from close first-degree relatives are susceptible to develop TA-GVHD due to a partial HLA match between the donor and the recipient.

This is a rare complication with very high mortality and has an incidence of 0.01 per 100,000 transfusions. The underlying mechanism is the transfusion of viable donor T lymphocytes that are present in blood products. T-lymphocytes engraft and proliferate in the host and induce an immune response characterized by fever, rash, liver dysfunction, pancytopenia, and gastrointestinal symptoms that develop over 1 to 6 wks after a transfusion. Pancytopenia due to bone marrow aplasia is usually the cause of fatality. Patients at the highest risk of this complication are the immunocompromised, such as very young patients, those receiving chemotherapy. Additionally, the patients receiving blood products from close first-degree relatives are susceptible to develop TA-GVHD due to a partial HLA match between the donor and the recipient.

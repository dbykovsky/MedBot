[70] The abdominal muscles are overstretched during pregnancy and strained during labor and are slow to regain their normal tone and elasticity, returning to pre-pregnancy levels by 6\u00a0to 8 weeks. The patient may have divarication of recti, and the striae or stretch marks over the abdomen and legs might not disappear.

Hyperpigmentation is the most commonly reported skin change during pregnancy, affecting 85%\u00a0to 90% of females. [64] The hypothesis is that melanocytes are sensitive to elevated levels of estrogen, progesterone, and endorphins during pregnancy. Humoral factors produced by the placenta lead to the upregulation of tyrosine kinase, promoting further melanin synthesis. [65] [66] The pigment changes accompanying pregnancy (melasma and linea nigra) usually disappear by 6\u00a0to 8 weeks.

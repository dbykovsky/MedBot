Iatrogenic pneumothorax is an important PSI condition associated with morbidity and mortality. Iatrogenic pneumothoraces are attributed to suboptimal procedure techniques/decision-making pitfalls, lack of medical provider experience, and\u00a0lack of ultrasound use during CVC placement. [25] Clinicians should prioritize the cautious insertion of medical devices, such as central venous catheters and chest tubes, to mitigate the risk of iatrogenic pneumothorax\u2014a potentially serious complication. Clinicians should utilize imaging guidance, like ultrasound, to enhance precision during procedures, avoiding inadvertent lung puncture. The proper technique and regular reassessment of needle or tube placement minimize complications.\u00a0A high level of awareness for patient-specific factors, such as underlying lung conditions, that may increase susceptibility should be maintained. Adherence to stringent aseptic practices and ongoing education on best practices are crucial for preventing iatrogenic pneumothorax in clinical settings."}

The diagnosis should be confirmed and the severity of the condition gauged through imaging (eg, chest x-ray). Small, asymptomatic cases may resolve spontaneously, but more significant or symptomatic pneumothoraces require intervention. Clinicians should opt for conservative measures like observation or supplemental oxygen if the pneumothorax is minor. Needle aspiration or chest tube insertion to evacuate air and re-establish lung expansion should be considered for more severe cases. Clinicians should regularly reassess the patient's respiratory status and adjust treatment accordingly, ensuring a tailored approach for optimal recovery.", "contents": "Iatrogenic Pneumothorax -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

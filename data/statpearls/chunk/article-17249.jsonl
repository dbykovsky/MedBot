Advancement flaps exhibit remarkable diversity in their shapes and sizes, tailored to the extensive array of anatomical sites to which they are applied. While it may not be entirely accurate to claim that no 2 advancement flaps are identical, the surgeon enjoys substantial flexibility when determining an advancement flap's optimal placement and design. Intriguingly, not all advancement flaps are confined to wound closure; for instance, facelift procedures incorporate the advancement and rotation of facial flaps, mirroring the principles utilized in cervicofacial advancement flaps for reconstructive objectives (see Image. SMAS Plication Rhytidectomy\u00a0and Image. Cervicofacial Advancement Flap). Moreover, scalp advancement techniques find utility in scenarios like lowering the hairline, particularly in gender affirmation surgery (see Image. Scalp Advancement Flap).

One concern is that an unpredicted solar particle event (e.g., solar flares) may expose space crew to unacceptably high radiation levels and cause acute radiation syndrome, which typically manifests following whole-body or partial-body exposure greater than 0.5 Gy. [1] Symptoms occur as a spectrum, dependent on the type, route, and dose of exposure, and typically lead to hematopoietic, gastrointestinal, neurovascular, and cutaneous manifestations. [1] [2] Of additional concern is chronic exposure to low-dose cosmic radiation. This exposure may be a factor for space crew, as well as long-haul commercial pilots or transport aircrew who experience exposure to increased cosmic and ultraviolet radiation at the typical cruising altitudes of modern aircraft (i.e., 10000 to 13000 m). Chronic exposure has been shown to increase the risk of nuclear cataracts in pilots compared with non-pilots. [3] Although anecdotal evidence suggests that aircrews are at an increased risk for malignancy, studies have reported conflicting results. Further research is warranted to ascertain the extent to which exposure to cosmic radiation affects subsequent long-term pathology.

Although an oversimplification, it is easy to conceptualize the physiologic changes at altitude as an inverse to that which occurs at depth; however, it is important to understand that the significant difference in density between water and air leads to more abrupt changes in partial pressures of gases at depth. Whereas the atmospheric pressure drops to one-half of its value at nearly 20000 ft, it requires a depth of only 33 ft of seawater to double atmospheric pressure. Thus, the short-term physiologic changes are mostly related to the behaviors of gas under pressure (Henry\u2019s law and Boyle\u2019s law) and give rise to many unique disease states when ascent, descent, and time at depth are not under strict control. Although there are notable and expected cardiovascular changes at normally encountered depths (reduction in heart rate, cardiac output, and preservation of stroke volume), [28] more pronounced changes and concerns relate to barotrauma, arterial gas embolism, and decompression sickness. Since the volume of gas is inversely related to the pressure at which it is subjected, failure to equalize pressure in the sinuses, lungs, ears, and other gas-filled pockets can result in barotrauma.

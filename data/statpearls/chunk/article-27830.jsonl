Initially, arachidonic acid is created when the enzyme phospholipase A2 cleaves the lipid diacylglycerol\u00a0into the molecule arachidonic acid. Cyclooxygenase enzymes then produce prostaglandins from arachidonic acid via sequential oxidation of each compound. [2] The COX-1 enzyme produces basal amounts of prostaglandins, while chemical mediators induce the COX-2 isoform to increase prostaglandins production.

There are 2 types of rectal prolapse: type 1 and type 2, also called false procidentia and true procidentia, respectively. Type 1, which is partial or mucosal prolapse, produces radial folds at the junction with the anal skin. This type usually involves less than 2 cm of prolapse, and only the mucosa is prolapsed. Type 2, or complete prolapse, is characterized by full-thickness extrusion of the rectal wall. Concentric folds are seen in the prolapse mucosa. This type of prolapse, which is\u00a0similar to\u00a0intussusception functionally, is further divided into first, second, and third-degree prolapse. First-degree type 2 prolapse protrudes greater than 5 cm from the anal verge and includes the mucocutaneous junction. Second-degree prolapse protrudes only 2 to 5 cm from the anal verge. Finally, third-degree prolapse or occult rectal prolapse is an internal process and thus does not protrude through the anal verge. [1] [4]", "contents": "Pediatric Rectal Prolapse -- Pathophysiology.

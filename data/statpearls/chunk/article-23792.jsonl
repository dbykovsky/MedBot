This disconnection allows the anterior subluxation seen in spondylolisthesis. Many biomechanical studies indicate that the pars is subjected to the greatest force of any structure in the lumbar spine; therefore, it is susceptible to stress fractures which may heal and fracture repeatedly over time. These injuries can induce non-healing fractures or an elongated pars without a defect which likely indicates repeated fracture healing. Pars fractures are believed to be the result of repetitive motion. Thus, risks associated with pars defects include activities associated with repetitive flexion/extension, axial loading, and rotational loading (i.e., golfers, weight lifers, baseball and football players, gymnasts).", "contents": "Isthmic Spondylolisthesis -- Etiology.

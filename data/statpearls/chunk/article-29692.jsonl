The same anatomic pathways account for the progression of necrotizing fascitis - Fournier gangrene within the perineal region. Buck's fascia and Colles' fascia limit the fasciitis progression beyond and beneath their attachments, secondary to the obliterative endarteritis of the arteries supplying the region due to endotoxemia. The treatment of a case of Fournier\u2019s gangrene is a surgical emergency and requires urgent surgical excision of the dead and infected tissue. [16] [17]"}

These glands secrete a fluid that lubricates the vagina. The Bartholin glands are not visible in normal circumstances, but if the glands are blocked, they can swell and present as a fluid-filled cyst. If the fluid gets infected, a condition known as bartholinitis occurs, which can lead to an abscess. The diagnosis requires a pelvic exam, and the treatment is incision and drainage with marsupialization. Unfortunately, a simple incision and drainage are associated with recurrences.

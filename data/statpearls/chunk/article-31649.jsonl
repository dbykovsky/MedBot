Hyperbaric oxygen therapy consists of placing a patient into a pressurized chamber of up to 3 atmospheres (ATM) of pressure. The surrounding ambient pressure at sea level is 1 ATM. Each additional ATM of pressure is equal to 33 feet (10 m) of depth of seawater or 14.7 pounds per square inch (psi) (101 kilopascals). The elevated\u00a0pressure combined with exposure to 100% oxygen has many physiologic effects on the body. Many of these physiologic changes have been shown to improve wound healing in chronic wounds. This has been proven in many\u00a0controlled studies.

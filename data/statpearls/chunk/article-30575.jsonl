However, despite these two drugs being within the same class and achieving the same desired result, they have two distinct mechanisms of action. While spironolactone is an aldosterone receptor antagonist operating at the late distal tubule and collecting tubules of the nephron on the apical aspect of these sites, triamterene acts at the same region of the nephrons but specifically at the epithelial sodium channels (ENaC), which are on the luminal side. These channels are transmembrane channels that operate to increase sodium uptake in exchange for secreting potassium. [4]", "contents": "Triamterene -- Mechanism of Action.

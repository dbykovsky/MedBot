Given the limitations of the current healthcare system and\u00a0the pressures it places on individual providers, each provider might consider focusing on addressing one\u00a0aspect of the individual's care while maintaining an understanding of the more significant contributors to the patient's presentation. Of primary importance is assessing and evaluating a trained social worker who can identify factors hindering patient care and outline the patient's expectations from treatment in depth. Communicating these factors to the trained specialty nurse can help educate patients and improve compliance with care. Identifying detrimental factors and adverse reactions and notifying the clinicians of these findings can help improve clinical outcomes and prevent complications. Electronic medical records could assist with this by computer-assisted identification of significant factors or deficits in the patient's life that may limit adherence, healthcare literacy, or communication."}

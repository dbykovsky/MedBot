If a significant drop in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) occurs after starting ramipril, the medication should be discontinued, and alternative treatment options should be considered. Monitoring for signs of postural hypotension, angioedema, and hyperkalemia is recommended, especially during the initial few weeks.

When determining what change from pre-treatment would indicate good response to treatment, it is necessary to determine the least significant change value (LSC), with the achievement of change in BTM levels exceeding this LSC value considered to be significant when compared to baseline measurements. [20] Fortunately, studies have shown that BTMs show minimal arbitrary fluctuation at the individual level, adding to the accuracy of this value. [10]"}

This study reported values at 12 weeks of treatment CTX-1 and P1NP LSC and observed effect value obtained using the two prominent automated assays currently on the market. For CTX-1 and P1NP, LSC and premenopausal RI were found to be -56% and 0.13-0.81 microgram/L and -38% and 15 to 54 microgram/L, respectively. However, in addition to the need to validate these findings on a larger scale, other limitations found included some patients showing BTM levels already in the lower half of the RI before treatment initiation. LSC method requires patients having levels checked before initiation of treatment, which is not standard clinical practice for reasons discussed throughout this article. [26] When evaluating levels of BTMs, it is crucial to be mindful of the multiple preanalytical factors and comorbid conditions influencing BTM levels. Osteoporotic patients presenting with severely elevated initial (greater than three standard deviations above the mean) BTM values are atypical in osteoporosis and should prompt a workup for other causes such as recent fracture, hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, Paget disease, chronic kidney disease or cancer.

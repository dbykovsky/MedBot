Identifying the facial nerve is essential when excising and resecting the parotid and submandibular gland to prevent further complications [23] . In the case of parotidectomies, the goal of the surgery is centered on carefully removing the tumor and the associated tissue margins of the gland and protecting the function of the facial nerve. Some anatomical landmarks for identifying the facial nerve are more effective than others. For example, the posterior digastric muscle and the tragal pointer are less reliable due to their variability or difficulty to localize.

The myometrium is evaluated for any pathology like fibroids or adenomyosis. The location and character of all pathological lesions are noted and documented in the images and the final report. Endometrium - The endometrium is measured perpendicularly from one echogenic to the other echogenic border at its thickest part in the midsagittal plane (Figure 5). If the fluid is visualized in the cavity, the endometrium is measured by combining the anterior and posterior endometrial thicknesses separately without including the fluid. Adnexa: The adnexa is evaluated for any masses such as hydrosalpinges, para-ovarian cysts, or para-tubal cysts. Ovaries: The ovaries are identified bilaterally and measured in three dimensions (length, height, and width) (Figure 6). The antral follicles are seen as round or oval anechoic structures. A baseline AFC is performed by counting the number of follicles between 2\u00a0to 10 mm and measuring the dimensions of follicles greater than or equal to 10 mm in the early follicular phase in both ovaries. [14] AFC can be measured using three different techniques during the transvaginal scan; a traditional real-time two-dimensional (2D) scan, stored 2D cine loops, or three-dimensional (3D) data sets. Real-time 2D scanning is used to measure the ovary in both the longitudinal and coronal planes. The next step is to optimize the ultrasound settings for better image quality while centering the ovary in its largest axis. The ovary should occupy at least 50% of the screen while counting the follicles ranging from 2\u00a0to 10 mm from one ovarian margin to the other.

Even though 3D ultrasound has better reproducibility than 2D methods, it needs additional special training and ultrasound equipment. The technique to perform 3D ultrasound is beyond the scope of this basic topic hence will not be discussed in detail.

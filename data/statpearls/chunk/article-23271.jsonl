Dangerously low magnesium levels can potentially cause fatal cardiac arrhythmias, such as torsades de pointes (polymorphous ventricular tachycardia with marked QT prolongation). Moreover, hypomagnesemia in patients with acute myocardial infarction puts them at a higher risk of ventricular arrhythmias within the first 24 hours. Furthermore, hypomagnesemia may also cause chondrocalcinosis. [14]"}

A growing proportion of SVC syndromes are now associated with occlusive venous thrombus formation that compromises venous flow back to the heart. The increasing use of indwelling intravascular devices such as catheters and pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) leads have played a major role in this growth.

This insidious onset is a result of a collateral vascular network that exists to divert blood to the lower body, where it is then returned to the heart through the inferior vena cava, azygous vein, and the intercostals. The clinical findings in SVC syndrome are closely linked to venous congestion and the resultant elevation in venous pressures seen in the upper body. A careful physical examination is often sufficient to rule out a cardiogenic origin to the patient\u2019s symptoms. The most common presenting symptoms of SVC syndrome are face/neck swelling, distended neck veins, cough, dyspnea, orthopnea, upper extremity swelling, distended chest vein collaterals, and conjunctival suffusion.

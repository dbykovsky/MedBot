Reverse cholesterol movement and stimulate cellular fatty acid uptake and modulate low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and ligand interaction. Fibrates promote receptor-mediated clearance of LDL after stimulating its secretion, causing this catabolism to occur at a 20% greater rate compared to an untreated patient. This action results in an overall decrease in very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). Small dense LDL, a fraction of LDL that produces the maximum peroxidation products, is reduced via the action of fibrates by activating lipoprotein lipase (LPL). Fibrates increase this LPL mediated lipolysis via activation of transcription factors for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR).

The prototypical ball and cage valve is the Starr-Edwards valve which, despite its longevity of use from the early\u00a01960s, was retired in 2007. \u00a0The occluder in this valve is a ball retained in a silicone-coated stainless steel cage. The sewing cuff is composed a Teflon ring with the intent minimizing thrombosis. During diastole (or systole for the mitral valve), the occluder ball would situate itself into the sewing ring, forming a seal to prevent retrograde flow. \u00a0The major drawback of this design is the subpar hemodynamics. The ball occluder of the ball and cage design disrupted the central flow of blood found in a native heart valve. Further designs were developed to help improve the hemodynamics. The non-tilting disc valve, composed of a flat, circular disc within a cage, did not necessarily\u00a0offer improved fluid dynamics but later bileaflet design performed better in emulating the natural hemodynamics of the native heart valve.Bioprosthetic valves are composed of three xenograft tissue leaflets of either porcine valvular leaflets or bovine pericardial tissue. \u00a0Both xenografts are treated with glutaraldehyde solution to reduce thromboembolic risk due as glutaraldehyde inhibits collagen denaturation. In a stented bioprosthetic valve, the leaflets get sewn to a cloth-covered (typically dacron) metallic support structure, similar to their mechanical counterparts. \u00a0The non-stented bioprosthetics require the prosthetic leaflets to attach directly into the aortic annulus. The bioprosthetic valves are hemodynamically improved compared to the mechanical valves but generate greater pressure gradients due to their smaller annulus.Homograft valves are valves obtained from human cadavers. \u00a0As such valves no longer have regenerative capabilities, they are more susceptible to cyclic stress. \u00a0Homograft valves are usable in conjunction\u00a0with an autograft valve. An autograft is a heart valve transplant from one anatomic point to a separate location within the same individual. \u00a0The Ross procedure is an example of a surgical intervention utilizing a homograft/autograft procedure.

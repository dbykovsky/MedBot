In the beginning, various studies showed limited riboflavin diffusion through the tight epithelial junctions, thus reducing the effectiveness of CXL. [26] However, this technique offered the advantage of no risk for keratitis, postoperative pain, and persistent epithelial defect. This problem has been overcome by adding chemicals that cause epithelial disruption, such as surfactant benzalkonium chloride (BAC) or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). [27]"}

This concept works on the Bunsen-Roscoe law of photochemical reciprocity: the same photochemical effect is achieved with a shorter irradiation time by a corresponding increase in irradiation intensity. The irradiation time is shortened from 30 minutes to 3 minutes with comparable results to the standard protocol and may be safe to use in thin corneas. [18] [29] Therefore it is inferred that a higher intensity will be needed with reduced exposure time to achieve the same total energy. In a landmark study by Wernii et al., they studied the effect of irradiance between 3 and 90 mW/cm2. They found that radiation intensity above 50 mW/cm^2 with a time of fewer than 2 minutes failed to increase the corneal stiffness. It is known that UVA is highly toxic to endothelial cells and has cytotoxic activity. Cytotoxic levels of UVA have been described as approximately 0.35 mW/cm2, which is twice that of protocol (0.18 mW/cm^2). Riboflavin helps in reducing the toxic effect of UVA and increases corneal stiffness.

When UV light is turned off, the oxygen level is returned to the original level from the environment within 3-4 minutes.

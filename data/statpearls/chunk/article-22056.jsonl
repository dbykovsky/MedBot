When diagnosed, patients typically consult with a gastroenterologist, who specializes in gastrointestinal disorders and can conduct necessary screenings and endoscopic procedures to monitor polyp growth. Genetic counselors play a crucial role in discussing the hereditary aspects of the condition, offering valuable insights into the familial implications and potential genetic testing options. Oncologists are essential for patients needing cancer-related treatments or interventions. Dermatologists address skin manifestations, while orthopedic surgeons manage bone-related complications like osteomas. Ophthalmologists focus on ocular issues, especially congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium. The interplay between these specialists is fundamental, ensuring a comprehensive and personalized approach to managing Gardner syndrome, addressing its diverse manifestations, and enhancing the patient's quality of life.", "contents": "Gardner Syndrome -- Consultations.

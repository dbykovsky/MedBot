Superior semicircular canal dehiscence was first described in 1998 and is a disease characterized by sound-induced vertigo\u00a0and eye movements, chronic dysequilibrium, conductive hearing loss (CHL), and decreased hearing thresholds for bone-conducted sounds. Conductive hyperacusis may lead to autophony (hearing one\u2019s own voice), pulsatile tinnitus, or hearing one\u2019s eye movements. [10] The disorder is caused by absent bone over the superior semicircular canal. When patients suffering from SSCD exhibit the Tullio phenomenon, they experience mixed vertical-torsional nystagmus in which the slow phase of nystagmus rotates up and away from the affected ear. This type of\u00a0nystagmus aligns in the same plane as the superior semicircular canal affected and is pathognomonic for SSCD.

Inhibition is caused by ampullopetal deflection of the cupola through negative EAC pressure via jugulovenous compression or glottis Valsalva. Patients may also experience the Hennebert sign, eye movement induced by pressure in the external auditory canal.

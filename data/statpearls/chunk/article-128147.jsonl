[3] [5] First, olfactory testing gives a more objective measure of olfactory abilities. This is important as many patients are neither aware of the degree of their olfactory deficits. Second, many patients experience an olfactory decline as a diminished perception of flavor. Therefore, olfactory testing can explore if a patient is experiencing olfactory rather than gustatory decline. Third, olfactory testing with multicomponent tests including olfactory threshold testing and suprathreshold tests such as odor identification and odor discrimination can reveal a pattern of olfactory decline, which may help to delineate the etiology of the olfactory decline. [2] For instance, a disease that primarily affects the nose, such as sinonasal disease, negatively impacts odor threshold while suprathreshold test results are normal.", "contents": "Olfactory Testing -- Clinical Significance.

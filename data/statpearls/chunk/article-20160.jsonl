Ringer's lactate is contraindicated in neonates aged 28 days and younger receiving ceftriaxone therapy, even if separate infusion lines are used, due to the risk of fatal ceftriaxone-calcium salt precipitation in the infant's bloodstream. Ringer's lactate is contraindicated in patients older than 28 days, including adults,\u00a0receiving concomitant ceftriaxone treatment through\u00a0the same\u00a0infusion line (eg, a Y-connector). If the same line is used for sequential infusions, it must be thoroughly flushed between administrations with a compatible fluid. Sodium acetate injection is contraindicated in patients with fluid retention or hypernatremia."}

{"id": "article-20681_1", "title": "Dose Calculation -- Equipment", "content": "The equipment needed to administer fluids can vary depending on how it is going to be administered. A needle and syringe will be needed to remove a medicine or fluid from a vial. Anytime a practitioner delivers a medication through an intravenous (IV) port they must use a flush to push the drug into the IV tubing or a bag of fluid such as normal saline. When calculating infusions, it is\u00a0important to use a drip chamber and know how many drops are needed to administer one mL of the fluid. There are two different styles of administration drip sets (gtt/set). One is a macro set that uses larger drops to add to 1 mL. Most macro sets are either 10, 15 or 20 drops to make 1 mL. The other drip set is a micro set, and it either takes 45 or 60 drops to make 1 mL. When giving most medications via continuous infusion, micro drip sets are the preferred method. One easy way to differentiate the two is by looking into the drip chamber. A clinician will see a micro set adapter that looks like a small silver pin coming from the bag end of the chamber. This pin causes the drops to be tiny, hence the term micro set. Some medications that are infused come in a glass vial. If this is the case, make sure to use a drip tubing that has a vent port to allow air into the bottle. Without this air entering the glass vial/bottle, the release of the fluid will eventually cause a suction, and the medication will stop flowing.", "contents": "Dose Calculation -- Equipment.

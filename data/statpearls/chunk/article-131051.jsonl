[20] [5] In lipedema, poor quality of life, immobility, and stress related to physical appearance can result in depression. Appropriate education about the disease, motivational interviewing, and counseling to focus on healthy eating patterns, activity, and social interaction, including internet groups and national and local groups, significantly impact a positive outcome. Referring to a psychotherapist, physical therapy, and pain management specialist is very useful when needed. [3] [21] [22]"}

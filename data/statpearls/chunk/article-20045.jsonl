[20] In children, the BMD assessment should take place serially, and referral to a pediatric bone health specialist may be in order if there is evidence of fragility or decline in BMD score. [2] Additionally, given the risk of osteonecrosis, evaluation for joint pain and reduced range of motion should be done at every visit. Adults should engage in preventive measures, including smoking cessation, reduced alcohol consumption, regular weight-bearing exercise, calcium, and supplement with vitamin D supplementation to reduce the risk of side effects.

The effect of anticoagulants, such as warfarin, may increase, which would require closer monitoring and potential dosage change. This effect would likely be at 3 to 7 days after starting the corticosteroid.

Corticosteroid effect may be reduced by some antivirals (e.g., efavirenz, nevirapine) and increased by others (e.g., atazanavir, indinavir, ritonavir), so closer monitoring for corticosteroid effect and toxicity is a recommendation during concurrent use. [2] Concomitant corticosteroid and NSAID use can increase the risk of peptic ulcer disease. Thus avoidance of concomitant use should be considered if possible, and patients should start antacid therapy with a PPI.

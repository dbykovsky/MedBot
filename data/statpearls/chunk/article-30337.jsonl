Skin infections, including cellulitis and abscess, can form at injection sites. Some abscesses can become so tense and circumferential that they cause compartment syndrome. Intravascular infections can grow on the heart valves, primarily the tricuspid valve [31] , which can require operative removal and replacement. [32]"}

After around 2012, the United States government began to shift the prioritization of money from interdiction and law enforcement to treatment programs to treat drug addicts, including those addicted to heroin. [37] This focus shift was brought about by several factors. One factor was a growing recognition that interdiction efforts, known commonly as the drug war, were not yielding results equivalent to the effort and money invested. There was also growing professional and lay acceptance of the concept of medication-assisted treatment, involving replacing the heroin with another full agonist opioid such as methadone or partial\u00a0opioid agonist like buprenorphine.

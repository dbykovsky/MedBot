Tobacco has long been associated with cardiovascular deaths, and it has been estimated that up to 10% of cardiovascular deaths worldwide in adults aged 30 years or older can be attributed to tobacco use. Tobacco smoke itself contains approximately 98 components that are hazardous when inhaled. [13] Evidence suggests that it\u00a0causes endothelial cell dysfunction, increases lipid oxidation, and activates both pro-inflammatory and procoagulation states.

{"id": "article-36586_1", "title": "Embryology, Lanugo -- Development", "content": "Lanugo plays an essential role in binding the vernix caseosa to the skin of fetuses. Vernix caseosa is the viscous white covering on newborns that protects their skin, prevents water loss, plays\u00a0an important\u00a0role in thermoregulation, and contributes to innate immunity. It protects the fetus from damaging substances found in amniotic fluid, most notably urea and electrolytes. [1] Lanugo is the first type of\u00a0hair to develop in humans. The interaction of lanugo with the vernix is also important in controlling the tempo of the fetal developmental rate during various times in the gestation cycle. Lanugo arises about three months into development. Hair growth starts on the scalp around the eyebrow, nose, and forehead area and proceeds in a cephalocaudal direction from head to toe. It is shed at about 33 to 36 weeks gestation, when it becomes subsequently incorporated into the amniotic fluid, eventually contributing to the composition of the meconium. Lanugo is ultimately replaced by vellus (fine, thin hair) and terminal hair (thicker hairs found on the scalp, axilla, and genitalia). Lanugo often remains present on 30% of newborns; this is a normal finding.", "contents": "Embryology, Lanugo -- Development.

{"id": "article-20885_1", "title": "Anatomy, Head and Neck, Parathyroid, Ectopic Glands -- Structure and Function", "content": "The parathyroid glands are typically located posterior to the thyroid glands, but anterior relative to the rest of the neck. These glands primarily function as the regulators of calcium homeostasis. If there is normal anatomy, the inferior parathyroid glands are located at the lower poles of the thyroid gland, while the superior parathyroid glands are present near the upper poles. [3] Typically, a person has four parathyroid glands, but the number of glands can vary from one, up to as high as twelve glands in total. [1] The parathyroid glands are activated via G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are sensitive to surrounding parathyroid hormone. These GPCRs exist on bone and kidney cells. [4] The parathyroid hormone itself functions by increasing renal tubular calcium reabsorption, enhancing net bone resorption, as well as stimulation net intestinal calcium absorption by increasing Vitamin D because of activation of 1-alpha-hydroxylase\u00a0in the proximal convoluted tubule. [5] Intermittent binding of PTH to its GPCR leads to bone formation, while constant binding leads to bone degradation. [4] Intermittent PTH activates osteoblast differentiation which enhances bone formation, resulting in net bone gain; continuous PTH leads to greater osteoclastogenesis. [6] PTH regulation is by ionized calcium, extracellular phosphate, and vitamin D. In contrast to other regulatory systems, the parathyroids are not under the direct influence of other glands and organs. Usually, in primary hyperparathyroidism, calcium levels remain elevated, while phosphate and Vitamin D levels are low (attempting to initiate negative feedback).

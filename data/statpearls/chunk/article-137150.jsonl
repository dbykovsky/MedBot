Indirect measures of LpX utilize the absence of apo-B in this structure by measuring the total cholesterol to apo-B ratio or the discrepancy in calculated vs. measured LDL levels in a serum sample. The total cholesterol to apo-B ratio is usually significantly increased in patients with LpX-induced hypercholesterolemia. [14] Some patients, however, may have only a slight increase in this ratio due to the co-existence of LpX elevation with LDL elevation. In these patients, the apo-B level is increased, lowering the total cholesterol to apo-B ratio. [14] In such cases, a discrepancy of measured vs. calculated LDL may be used to demonstrate the presence of LpX. One case study reported total cholesterol of 982\u2009mg/dL, triglycerides of 115\u2009mg/dL, and HDL cholesterol of 32\u2009mg/dL, for a calculated LDL of 927\u2009mg/dL.

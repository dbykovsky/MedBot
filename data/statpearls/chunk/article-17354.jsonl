While the indications of alginate wound dressings are different in each of these contexts, a few underlying principles are generally relevant. Because alginates allow for the relatively free diffusion of water and solutes, alginate dressings are thought to generate a relatively physiologic environment at the wound interface that encourages healing. Additionally, some research postulates that calcium release from alginate hydrogels crosslinked with calcium stimulates coagulative pathways and which results in a healing response. While alginate dressings see extensive use in wound healing, few well-controlled studies definitively link their usage to improvements in outcomes.

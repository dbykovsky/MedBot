[16] Additionally, the multiple neurosurgical interventions and costs associated with them are an issue of concern. [16] Other procedures have been proposed to treat and manage hydrocephalus as an alternative to shunts. [16] Endoscopic choroid plexus coagulation (ECPC) is an alternative to treat rapidly enlarging heads in patients with hydranencephaly due to hydrocephalus. [16] [17] Multiple studies have reported better outcomes in patients treated with ECPC than in those treated with shunts with a\u00a0success rate of 50\u00a0to 80%. [16] [17] [18] This success rate is high enough to propose that ECPC could be used as the standard of care in the treatment of hydrocephalus or an enlarging head in an infant diagnosed with hydranencephaly.

[16] [18] This is because patients with hydranencephaly have certain anatomical characteristics that make ECPC possible, such as the lack of septum pellucidum (lack of hemispheric separation), which allows easy access to bilateral choroid plexuses, and the lack of brain parenchyma which makes the choroid plexus the principal production area of CSF. [16] A complication associated with ECPC is arachnoid collapse. It occurs when the dura is opened to pass the endoscope, which liberates the intracranial pressure and leads to arachnoid collapse with the\u00a0inability to coagulate the choroid plexuses.

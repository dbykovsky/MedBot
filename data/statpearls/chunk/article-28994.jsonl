Prophylactic use of shoulder dystocia maneuvers:\u00a0Some clinicians have attempted to prevent shoulder dystocia by implementing the McRoberts maneuver or suprapubic pressure before the fetal head is delivered in patients with risk factors for shoulder dystocia (eg, a macrosomic fetus, maternal diabetes). However, a Cochrane review found no clear evidence for or against this practice as the studies analyzed were underpowered, and maternal outcomes were not adequately addressed. [7]"}

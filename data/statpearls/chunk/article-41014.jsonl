COPD exacerbations are also a common reason for hospital admission. Many patients with COPD benefit from NIV in the acute setting. However, a large limitation of NIV is the low level of patient compliance and comfort. High-flow nasal cannula therapy\u00a0provides the benefit of PEEP and increased oxygen saturation that NIV supplies but increases patient comfort and compliance. In addition, Dzira et al. (2017) discovered that in GOLD stage III and IV COPD patients, high-flow nasal cannula at flow rates greater than 30 L per minute decreased the respiratory rate, inspiratory time to total breath time ratio, and diaphragmatic work of breathing compared to NIV.

Educational sessions should be held for nurses, respiratory therapists, and other clinicians before the treatment is introduced in the hospital. A collaborative interprofessional team comprised of a respiratory therapist, the clinical or critical care nurse, and a medical provider can greatly improve patient outcomes when undergoing high-flow nasal cannula therapy. The bedside nurse can assist the medical team by monitor the patient's vital signs and respiratory effort while on high-flow therapy to ensure there is no risk of impending respiratory compromise. The respiratory therapist can titrate the flow and oxygen percentage to meet the patient's needs and decrease the risk of over oxygenation or barotrauma. Communicating the efficacy of high-flow nasal cannula with the medical provider or the need for a higher level of respiratory support when needed, the nurses and respiratory therapists can enhance healthcare outcomes by notification of the medical team leading to timely adjustments for the patient.

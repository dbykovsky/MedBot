There was no difference seen in overall survival. [15] A separate randomized, open-label, multicenter study conducted by Joensuu et al. compared 1 year vs. 3 years of adjuvant imatinib therapy for patients following GIST resection and found improved 5 years RFS (65.6% vs. 47.9%) and overall survival (92.0% vs. 81.7%) in the 3-year treatment group. [16] based on the results of these trials, the ESMO recommends 3 years of adjuvant imatinib therapy in patients with high risk for relapse and shared decision making for patients with low risk. [9] The most recent NCCN guidelines were published shortly after the completion of the trial by DeMatteo et al. and before completion of Joensuu et al., and therefore do not recommend adjuvant therapy. [4] When using imatinib for adjuvant therapy, the accepted dosing remains 400 mg daily."}

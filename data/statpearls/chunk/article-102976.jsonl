The left ASIS is lower than the right, and the left PSIS is lower than the right. To treat a left inferior shear, the patient must hop on their left leg for 10 to 15 seconds. The physician will then examine the ASIS and PSIS heights to determine somatic dysfunction resolution. The techniques explained above are described only for one side of the pelvis. However, these techniques apply to either side of the innominate bone.", "contents": "Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment: Muscle Energy Procedure - Pelvic Dysfunctions -- Technique or Treatment.

Initial management depends on the patient's clinical condition and probable etiology. If the patient is stable, most of the work can be done as an outpatient with regular follow-ups in the gastroenterology clinic. However, if the patient is febrile and showing signs of sepsis and hepatic dysfunction, admitting the patient for evaluation and treatment may be necessary. This is needed in patients with acute cholangitis, cholecystitis, and acute liver failure. Treatment [17] Treatment varies widely depending on the etiology of biliary obstruction. Some common etiologies and board management are discussed below. Cholelithiasis and Choledocholithiasis [18] [19] Gallstones with common bile duct (CBD) stones; CBD size less than 1.5cm with small stones- ERCP and sphincterotomy with cholecystectomy CBD size more than 1.5cm with large stones - ERCP and sphincterotomy with lithotripsy, choledochotomy, choledochoduodenostomy, choledochojejunostomy, or cholecystectomy CBD Stricture [20]"}

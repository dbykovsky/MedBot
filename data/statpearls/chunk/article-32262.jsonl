As with all aspects of medicine, a continuing amount of research will likely change our future understanding of smooth muscle and its overall effects on disease. Current research into smooth muscle has shown promise in future implications such as restoring endothelial tissue which in the future\u00a0could lead to new ways to encourage revascularization. Even small changes in understanding like this could have an astronomical impact on the treatment and mortality of cardiovascular disease\u00a0in the future. [4] While smooth muscle remains an exceptionally deep topic, a solid understanding of its impact on healthcare even at the most basic level will give healthcare professionals tools to provide better healthcare outcomes now and into the future."}

As more time and effort is put into understanding smooth muscle our ability to treat the pathophysiology that comes with its dysfunction will broaden. It is important the clinicians continue to learn and study the impact that smooth muscle can have. As discussed, future methods may involve stimulating the regrowth of tissue with smooth muscle modulating factors. It is not inappropriate to think that\u00a0many advances in the future\u00a0of medical management will focus on impacting smooth muscle\u00a0in some way or another.", "contents": "Anatomy, Smooth Muscle -- Other Issues.

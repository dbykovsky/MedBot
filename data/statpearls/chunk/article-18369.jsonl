[2] Bleomycin has since received a wide array of FDA-approved therapeutic indications, including germinal cell tumors, gestational trophoblastic disease, Hodgkin lymphoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Non-FDA-approved indications include AIDS-associated Kaposi sarcoma, osteosarcoma, malignant melanoma, and advanced stages of mycosis fungoides.

In pleurodesis, bleomycin can be injected into the pleural space, causing the lung to adhere to the chest wall, thus preventing the collection of fluid or air. Pleurodesis is typically reserved for use in patients with recurrent malignant effusions after more conservative management, such as repeat thoracocentesis, has proven unsuccessful in preventing effusion recurrence.

{"id": "article-18369_3", "title": "Bleomycin -- Mechanism of Action", "content": "The primary mechanism of action of bleomycin involves the drug's ability to oxidatively damage DNA by binding to metal ions, including iron, forming metallobleomycin complexes.

The diagnostic process usually commences with a comprehensive history and physical examination conducted by a primary care physician. Common initial symptoms of ALS may include muscle weakness, poor coordination, slurred speech, or shortness of breath during moderate exertion. When patients present with ALS symptoms, they will be referred to a neurologist who will conduct a comprehensive set of diagnostic evaluations. These evaluations may include electrical conduction studies, pulmonary function tests, blood tests, and imaging studies to aid in reaching an accurate diagnosis.", "contents": "Tofersen -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

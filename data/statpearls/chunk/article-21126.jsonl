The endotracheal tube size (\"give me a 6.0 tube\") refers to its internal diameter in millimeters (mm). The ETT will typically list both the inner and outer diameter of the tube (for example, a 6.0 endotracheal tube will list both the internal diameter, ID 6.0,\u00a0 and outer diameter, OD 8.8). The narrower the tube, the greater the resistance to gas flow. Medical providers, thus, should select the largest tube that is appropriate for the patient; this is critically important to the spontaneously breathing patient who will have to work harder to overcome the increased resistance (a size 4 ETT has 16 more times resistance to gas flow than a size 8 ETT). The ETT is measured from the distal end of the tube and is typically marked in 2 cm increments. After successfully intubating the patient, the depth of the endotracheal tube ending at the teeth or lips should be noted. This depth provides a baseline measurement to ensure the tube has not traveled out of the trachea or deeper into the trachea with patient movement or transport. PVC is not radiopaque, and thus, a radiopaque linear material is included throughout the length of the tube to make it easier to visualize the placement on X-ray.

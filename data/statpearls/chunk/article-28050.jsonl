Although surgery has been historically the standard of treatment, the emergence of embolization as an alternative further requires patient participation in treatment choice, particularly for those with limited pulmonary function or hesitancy toward surgery. Even though surgical resection is the treatment of choice, there is emerging evidence of a neo-adjuvant approach of embolization before surgery to reduce intraoperative hemorrhagic complications. The exact duration of postoperative surveillance and follow up is yet to be established and is contingent upon individual center standards.", "contents": "Pulmonary Sequestration -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

Data from clinical trials and observational studies have demonstrated that adherence to therapy is essential to PrEP effectiveness. A pharmacokinetic study of oral PrEP estimated effectiveness to be 99% if doses are taken 7 days a week, 96% for 4 doses per week, and 76% for 2 doses per week.[CDC. PrEP Guidelines. 2021] While this suggests that 100% adherence is not required for benefit, optimal benefit is only achieved with high adherence rates. Also, lower levels of active metabolites of PrEP medications have been found in vaginal tissues as compared with colorectal tissues, strongly suggesting that greater adherence may be required for women taking PrEP."}

Some patients diagnosed with narcolepsy type 2 will eventually present with cataplexy and have the diagnosis changed to narcolepsy type 1. Many patients have symptoms that do worsen over time. Although it is unlikely that symptoms will improve on their own over time, they are generally well managed with a combination of behavioral interventions and medications.

The mechanism is immunologic. Desflurane undergoes some metabolism by cytochrome P450 to produce trifluoroacetate, which binds to hepatocyte proteins, forming complexes that stimulate antibody formation. Exposures after antibody formation can lead to hepatic necrosis. This is much less common than other agents, such as halothane, but is still possible, given the metabolite. Currently, no specific treatment is available for the hepatic effects of desflurane. Consequently, desflurane or similar inhalational anesthetics should be avoided if hepatic impairment is suspected.

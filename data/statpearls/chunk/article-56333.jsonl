MRI can accurately and precisely delineate the degree of tumor in the adjacent soft tissues, joint involvement, whether or not the tumor crosses the physis, proximity to the nearest neurovascular bundle. Nearly every aspect of treatment is assessable with MRI, from pre-surgical assessment for limb-sparing resection to the degree of chemotherapy response in the form of tumor necrosis, shrinkage, and improved capsulation. [8] Traditional sequences acquired in MRI of osteosarcoma may demonstrate the following: [8] T1 Weighted Images Non-ossified soft tissue component: intermediate signal intensity Osteoid components: low signal intensity Peritumoral edema: intermediate signal intensity Scattered foci of hemorrhage: variable signal intensity based on chronicity T2 Weighted Images Non-ossified soft tissue component: high signal intensity Osteoid components: low signal intensity Peritumoral edema: high signal intensity Computed Tomography - the role of CT is primarily to assist with biopsy planning and disease staging. CT may not significantly contribute to direct assessment of the tumor after radiography and MRI unless the osseous lesion in question is predominantly lytic. In the case of lytic lesions, small amounts of mineralized material may be unobservable on both plain film and MRI. CT of the chest, however, is the modality of choice for the evaluation of metastasis. [8]"}

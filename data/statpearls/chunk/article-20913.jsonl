[51] Due to the complexity and multifunctionality of the frontal lobes, FLE can manifest as complex psychiatric conditions associated with motor, cognitive, and medical changes, thereby including FLE as a differential diagnosis for complex neuropsychiatric reports. [52] Characterizing frontal lobe seizures proves challenging due to their brevity, intricate motor behaviors, and emotional expressions. This challenge extends to interpreting semiologic and EEG patterns, compounded by the extensive connectivity of the frontal lobe with other brain regions, facilitating rapid and generalized seizure propagation.

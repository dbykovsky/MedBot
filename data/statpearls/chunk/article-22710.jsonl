A microscopic urinalysis of a properly obtained urine sample showing >3 RBC/HPF is sufficient to warrant further evaluation. Patients on anticoagulants who develop hematuria still need a full and proper evaluation. Female patients with hematuria are the most likely to receive inadequate or incomplete evaluations, most likely due to their high incidence of UTIs and potential contamination of the urine from vaginal bleeding. It is vital, possibly life-saving, to perform follow-up urinalyses in such patients to identify those with persistent microhematuria requiring further evaluation. In patients who present with hematuria and UTI, the resolution of hematuria tested at least 6 weeks after antibiotic treatment should be documented, as UTI and malignancy can coexist.", "contents": "Gross and Microscopic Hematuria -- Pearls and Other Issues.

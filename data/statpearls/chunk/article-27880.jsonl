The digestive enzymes are present in kwashiorkor; however, because there is little protein ingested, symptoms of protein deficiency are present. In malnourished individuals with kwashiorkor, the vital reactions in the body are sustained through intracellular protein catabolism. The need for available essential amino acids leads to an extensive reduction in peripheral muscle mass from muscle breakdown. [10] Protein deficiency also leads to decreased serum levels of albumin, thus decreasing intravascular colloid pressure, which leads to edema and abdominal distention. Severe kwashiorkor quickly deteriorates because digestive enzymes are no longer produced, and the small intestinal epithelium is not regenerated.", "contents": "Biochemistry, Protein Catabolism -- Pathophysiology.

Cystinuria and Hartnup disease are both genetic disorders involving the membrane amino acid transporters but differ in the groups of amino acids transported and so present different clinically. [9] Cystinuria is a defect in transporting basic amino acids through the membranes of the renal and gastrointestinal systems. The hallmark presentation of this disorder is the formation of renal calculi due to the inability to resorb the basic amino acid cystine from the glomerular filtrate. Because the transporter also exists on the small intestine epithelium, cystine and other basic amino acids are not well absorbed from the intestinal lumen. A mechanistically similar disorder, Hartnup disease is a defect in transporting neutral amino acids across the renal and intestinal system. Because tryptophan is one of the neutral amino acids poorly absorbed, a pellagra-like presentation of rash, diarrhea, and psychiatric disturbances are present on physical exam. Unlike pellagra, supplementation with niacin has little resolution of symptoms and should reveal the need for genetic testing.", "contents": "Biochemistry, Protein Catabolism -- Pathophysiology.

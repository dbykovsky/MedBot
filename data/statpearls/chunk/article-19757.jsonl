It travels across the lateral aspect of the knee over the neck of the fibula, where its only protection is skin and subcutaneous fat and fascia. Thus, various trauma to the lateral knee often results in damage to the common fibular nerve. For example, if a football player is tackled from the side, the result may be a fibular neck fracture and common fibular nerve injury.

Because there is a loss of dorsiflexion, the toes will drag on the ground rather than clear the ground as in a normal gait.

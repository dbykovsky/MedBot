The manifestation of extensive cellulitis-like plaques has been identified as an infrequent clinical sign of Sweet syndrome. The designation \"giant cellulitis-like Sweet syndrome\" was employed to describe the occurrence of extensive infiltrating inflammatory plaques and bullae in three patients who met the diagnostic criteria for Sweet syndrome. [26] The phenomenon of pathergy, wherein a cutaneous lesion is triggered by minor trauma, is demonstrated in AFND in common with other neutrophilic dermatoses. The probable mechanism could be the destruction of endothelial cells, cytokine dysregulation, and resultant neutrophil activation."}

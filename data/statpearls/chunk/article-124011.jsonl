The concept of \u201cbaby lung\u2019 in ARDS represents the relatively small areas of aerated normal lung (which is just the size of a baby\u2019s lung), which needs to be protected from injury during mechanical ventilation. Since most of the remaining alveoli are non-aerated and collapsed, delivery of a large tidal volume could overinflate the baby lung areas inciting lung injury. The baby lung is not a fixed anatomic structure since redistribution of dependent atelectasis occurs in prone positioning. The ideal tidal volume might have been the tidal volume required to ventilate the baby's lung, which has been evaluated only in physiologic studies at this stage."}

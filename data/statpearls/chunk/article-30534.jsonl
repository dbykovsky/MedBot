[17] Spinal shock is a condition that may arise from traumatic spinal cord injury. The symptoms include flaccid paralysis below the level of spinal cord damage, loss of DTRs, decreased sympathetic outflow, and absent sphincter reflexes or tone. [18] The decreased sympathetic outflow leads to vascular smooth muscle relaxation and blood vessel dilation, producing hypotension. [19] Bradycardia also results from reduced sympathetic stimulation. Spinal shock may resolve over weeks to months. Afterward, spastic paralysis and hyperreflexia below the injured spinal nerve's level manifest. Some sphincter and erectile reflexes may return, often without voluntary control."}

Pulsed Doppler Method (Pulsed Wave (PW) method). The pulsed Doppler method is based on the principle that, in the absence of significant valvular regurgitant lesion(s) and intracardiac shunt, stroke volume (SV) through any cardiac valve should be the same to maintain a uniform cardiac output. So, to compensate for regurgitant flow volume, SV through the pertinent valve increases proportionately. SV, through any valvular annulus, is calculated by the cross-sectional area of the annulus and velocity-time integral (VTI) of the flow-through that annulus. Except for the tricuspid annulus, all other three valves have near-circular annuli with minor variations. SV is then calculated from these annuli, and SV of normal aortic or pulmonic valve is subtracted from SV of the mitral valve to obtain regurgitant volume (RV). Regurgitant fraction (RF) can be calculated from the ratio of RV to SV through the mitral valve. RV less than 30 ml is mild, and greater than 60 ml is severe. Errors can be introduced with incorrect measurements of the annulus, angulation, and VTI."}

When the diagnosis of MR is suspected based on symptoms, physical examination, and/or investigation, the patient should be referred to a cardiologist. Based on the severity of MR with structural changes seen on echocardiogram and symptoms, cardiovascular physicians can recommend medical treatment versus surgical intervention. In the latter case, a thorough discussion with the heart valve team, preferably in the experienced center, should be carried out to determine the most appropriate therapeutic approach. [59]"}

It is defined as the leaking of blood flow from the left ventricle (LV) to the left atrium (LA). Most patients do not have any symptoms, but with the progression of leakiness, they can have shortness of breath, chest pain, exercise intolerance, leg swelling, and many more. Patients should seek medical attention in case of any of these symptoms. Investigations including EKG, echocardiogram, chest x-ray, and advanced tests of imaging can confirm the diagnosis. After confirmation of the diagnosis of clinically significant MR, routine surveillance and regular follow-up should be done under cardiology services. Depending on etiology, symptomatology, results of investigations, and team discussions, the patient should be guided for medical treatment and/or surgical treatment, including open-heart surgery or transcatheter intervention. [46] [59] Several factors, including etiology of MR, age and demographics, comorbidities, baseline functional status, LV size, and EF, need to be taken into account before making recommendations for treatment. If deemed suitable for surgical intervention, thorough counseling about the risks and benefits of surgery should be done.

Weaning from ECMO can be initiated when improvement on chest X-ray, lung compliance, and arterial oxyhemoglobin concentration is noted. ECMO trials are done by removing all the countercurrent sweep gas through the oxygenator but keeping blood flow constant with no gas exchange. This will be done for several hours, where the patient's ventilator settings are adjusted to maintain oxygenation and ventilation off ECMO. Absolute contraindications for ECMO rescue therapy include a preexisting condition not compatible with recovery (end-stage malignancy, severe neurological injury), and some of the relative contraindications include uncontrollable bleeding and very poor prognosis of the primary condition."}

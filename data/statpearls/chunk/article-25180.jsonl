Pill esophagitis, characterized by symptoms such as chest pain, odynophagia, and dysphagia, has been documented as an adverse effect of minocycline. This effect can be mitigated by consuming oral minocycline formulations with sufficient water and maintaining an upright posture after ingesting the medication. [22] Although\u00a0adverse effects caused by minocycline treatment are infrequent, the elevated concentrations of the drug in the CNS compared to other tetracyclines contribute to the dose-limiting vestibular adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, vertigo, dizziness, or hearing loss. [23] [24] Studies have additionally established a connection between the utilization of tetracyclines and the occurrence of idiopathic intracranial hypertension, also known as pseudotumor cerebri."}

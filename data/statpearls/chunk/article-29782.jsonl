Swallowing sounds like a simple physiological human function, but it is a complex, multifaceted process involving a variety of muscles and nerves.

Deglutition in humans can be of three distinct phases: oral phase, pharyngeal phase, and esophageal phase, of which the first one is voluntary, and the other two are reflex actions. The oral phase further divides into an oral preparatory phase and an oral propulsive phase. The location of the food bolus defines each of these phases as it descends towards the stomach.

The oral preparatory stage begins when food or liquid is consumed through diet and enters the oral cavity. When drinking liquids, the posterior tongue rises to meet the soft palate to ensure a proper seal, preventing leakage of liquid oral cavity contents into the oropharynx before the swallow initiates voluntarily.\u00a0 This seal does not form between the palate and tongue during the mastication of solid foods, and therefore free communication between the oral cavity and oropharynx is preserved. Immediately before the initiation of a swallow, the anterior tongue rises to meet the hard palate as the posterior tongue drops and opens the oropharynx. The bolus is then propelled down the palate by the tongue toward the oropharynx; this is the oral propulsive stage. Contrast this with consuming liquids as the pharyngeal stage begins throughout the oral propulsive stage. The first irreversible step in swallowing, the pharyngeal stage, occurs next and is categorized by a rapid phase of muscle contraction to propel the bolus through the upper esophageal sphincter and into the esophagus. This stage starts when the consumed bolus makes its way to the palatoglossal arch. [2] The protection of the airway is essential to this stage and occurs by the induction of a swallowing apnea. This cessation in breathing usually occurs toward the end of expiration and helps prevent the aspiration of consumed material.

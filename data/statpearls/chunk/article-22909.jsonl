It is comprised of over 200 genes, encoding for several different molecules involved in immune defense. [1] All human genes encoding MHC molecules are present on the short arm of chromosome 6. Two principal types of MHC molecules involved in antigen presentation and the associated immune response are class I and class II MHC molecules. Three unique loci contain genes that code for Class I MHC molecules, defined as A, B, and C. Class II MHC genes are at loci called DR, DQ, and DP. Multiple alleles are possible at each of these loci, and an individual can be either homozygous or heterozygous for each gene, thus creating the polymorphism (Figure 1). Genes of the MHC system are codominant, and therefore all inherited alleles code for specific MHC molecules to express on a cell surface. As a consequence, every human inherits a set of genes for A, B, C, DR, DP, and DQ. Remarkable variability exists ensuring that a person\u2019s MHC type is unique.

After MHC class I chains are synthesized, they are first bound to calnexin, a membrane-bound molecule in the rough ER that stabilizes the chain until it can bind to beta2-microglobulin. After synthesis, chaperone proteins calreticulin, tapasin, and ERp57 additionally stabilize the molecule until an antigenic peptide binds. Proteins synthesized in the cytoplasm are then cleaved into peptides about 8 to 10 amino acids long and transported to the ER by ATP-dependent transporter proteins TAP1 or TAP2, where they can bind to MHC class I molecules. Any antigen that produces intracellular proteins, whether viral, bacterial, or tumor in etiology, could bind to MHC. Also, defective proteins that did not fold correctly and are digested by proteasomes, also known as defective ribosomal products (DRiPs) could bind to MHC. Tapasin is a molecule involved in stabilizing the transfer of peptides from TAP transporters to MHC molecules.

During development, the diaphragm develops near the newly developing nerves. Some literature describes the phrenic nerve developing directly ventral to the diaphragm during development. As the fetus continues to grow, the points of origin and insertion of the phrenic nerve draw gradually apart due to the descent of the diaphragm and the elevation of the cervical nerves as it accompanies the development of other structures in the neck.

These patients should have close follow up to ensure that renal function is not deteriorating. Finally, the patient needs to be given advice on healthy eating, exercise, discontinuing tobacco and abstaining from alcohol. Kidney disease is not well managed can lead to complete renal failure, which requires dialysis. [11] [12] Open communication between the team members can reduce the morbidity and mortality of renal failure."}

[42] Persistently elevated serum\u00a0\u03b2- 2 microglobulin\u00a0is frequently noted in patients with acute and chronic renal disease; even the small-sized \u03b2- 2 microglobulin molecule has difficulty passing through the injured glomerular apparatus.

Before surgical intervention, use the known half-life of the biomarker to estimate the time required for the level to decline to a normal or undetectable level. [40] If the quantitative decline of a tumor biomarker will be used to determine the likelihood of complete tumor resection, biomarkers should not be measured until at least 2 weeks and ideally 4 weeks postoperatively.

{"id": "article-72242_1", "title": "Pathophysiology Of Asthma -- Organ Systems Involved", "content": "The organ system affected by asthma is the lungs. The lungs consist of lobes and segments, with the right lung having ten segments and the left lung having eight or nine, depending on the division of the lobe. [8] Anatomically, the respiratory system falls into two zones, characterized by the conducting zone and the respiratory zone. The conducting zone extends from the nose to the bronchioles, and the respiratory zone where gas exchange takes place is from the alveolar duct to the alveoli. [9] Asthma is primarily involved in the bronchial tree, with its primary job to distribute air throughout the lungs until reaching the alveolar sacs. The bronchi stem from the end of the trachea, which divides into left and right bronchi. The right bronchus has a wider diameter and lies more vertically, while the left bronchus is smaller and more horizontal. The bronchi then divide into secondary and tertiary bronchi. The bronchi contain smooth muscle and elastic fibers to maintain their wall integrity, which change based on the contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle by inflammatory mediators, bronchoconstrictor, or bronchodilators. [10] As one progresses further from the bronchi to the alveoli, there are much more smooth muscle fibers involved. [9] In normal respiratory physiology, lung compliance is the willingness for the lungs to distend, while elastance is the ability of the lungs to return to their resting position. In patients with asthma, the physiologic mechanism changes due to inflammation, decreasing the radius of the airway. [11] All of these mechanisms together change the compliance of the lungs slightly to increase the work of breathing.", "contents": "Pathophysiology Of Asthma -- Organ Systems Involved.

The early phase is initiated by IgE antibodies that are sensitized and released by plasma cells. These antibodies respond to certain triggers in the environment, such as the risk factors listed above. IgE antibodies then bind to high-affinity mast cells and basophils. When a pollutant or risk factor gets inhaled, the mast cells release cytokines and eventually de-granulate. Released from mast cells are histamine, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes. These cells, in turn, contract the smooth muscle and cause airway tightening. [12] Th2 lymphocytes play an integral role where they produce a series of interleukins (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) and GM-CSF, which aid in communication with other cells and sustain inflammation.

[14] It is critical to recognize both of these two mechanisms to target therapy and relieve both bronchoconstriction and inflammation, depending on the severity of the disease.

Asthmatic patients can usually have but are not limited to, wheezing, shortness of breath, and a cough, which is often worse at night. There are various triggers that intensify asthma. Such triggers are cold air, exercise, and the pollutants listed above. Other non-specific symptoms that could suggest a severe obstruction can be tachypnea, tachycardia, or a patient seated in a tripod position.\u00a0Asthma can be a severe disease if not treated and managed correctly . Since there are two phases of asthma, it is essential to try to target and decrease bronchoconstriction, inflammation, and airway remodeling. Asthma is defined in different stages depending on spirometry and/or clinical indications. There are four stages regarding the severity of asthma, intermittent, mild, moderate, and severe. Depending on the specific stage of asthma, treatment and management change. Intermittent asthma occurs when one has symptoms less than\u00a0two days a week and nighttime awakenings less than\u00a0two times a month. Mild asthma consists of having episodes more than two days a week (but not daily), while there are nighttime awakenings of 3\u00a0to 4 times a month. Moderate asthma is where the patient is symptomatic daily and has nighttime awakenings greater than once a week but not nightly. Severe asthma is when a patient is symptomatic throughout the day and often has nighttime awakenings more than\u00a0seven times within a week. Based on these criteria, correct treatment can be administered to decrease the symptoms of the patient. The most common medications used are short-acting beta-agonists, long-acting beta-agonists, muscarinic antagonists, and inhaled and systemic glucocorticoids . The idea behind a beta-agonist is to try to bronchodilate the patient\u2019s lungs when they become constricted during an asthma attack. The mechanism behind beta-agonists is that they are G protein receptors that activate cAMP. cAMP then activates smooth muscle relaxation by a mechanism not fully understood. Also, a glucocorticoid may be used to decrease the inflammation and remodeling of the lungs. The primary mechanism of a glucocorticoid is to increase the production of IL-10. IL-10 inhibits inflammatory cytokines, T-cell activation, and different white cells such as mast cells and eosinophils. [22] These effects decrease inflammation and help the patient breathe better in the short and long term. Muscarinic antagonists block the inflammatory effect by diminishing the attraction and life of inflammatory cells, diminishing cytokine release.

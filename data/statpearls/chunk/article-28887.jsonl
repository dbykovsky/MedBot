{"id": "article-28887_1", "title": "Sensory Integration -- Definition/Introduction", "content": "SI describes how the nervous system integrates sensory input into action. Two structures may be affected in registration and modulation disturbances: the limbic system and the vestibular and proprioceptive systems. The vestibular system is in charge of the sensory information from body movement through space. The proprioceptive system has a role in processing sensory input from joints and muscles. When impaired, it can lead to issues such as hand flapping [3] . Ayres hypothesized that the vestibular system is in charge of deciding whether we will act on a stimulus or not, while the vestibular nuclei register visual stimuli and give it meaning. [1] [4] The over or under reaction to tactile or vestibular input may lead to gravitational insecurity or fear of movement, tactile defensiveness, or both. Ayers' identification of the amygdala\u00a0playing\u00a0an important role in sensory registration has been backed up by recent studies that associate the amygdala with reward associations. [1] For instance, hyperactivation in the amygdala due to eye contact may be why individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) avoid eye contact.", "contents": "Sensory Integration -- Definition/Introduction.

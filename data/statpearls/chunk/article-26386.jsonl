Osteoporosis is an age-related microarchitectural deterioration of bone, hypothesized to occur due to an imbalance between osteoblasts and osteoclasts. While osteoporosis is common in postmenopausal females, it can occur in males as well. Postmenopausal females have lower estrogen levels, and estrogen is known to be a potent inhibitor of osteoclasts. Therefore, postmenopausal females lose that osteoclast inhibition, which then leads to increased osteoclast bone resorption.

It is the second most common bone disorder in that age group in the United States and the United Kingdom. While it can manifest with bony abnormalities and disfigurations of the skull, pelvis, and spine, it can also include deafness and nerve compression. In the majority of patients with the disease, it is asymptomatic. Paget disease has correlations with increased osteoclastic activity, but the exact cause is still unknown. Some studies have linked it to paramyxoviruses, but there has not been concrete evidence regarding its pathogenesis. Paget disease typically occurs in four stages. The first stage primarily shows increased osteoclastic activity. The second stage is a mix of osteoclastic and osteoblastic activity, the third stage being primarily osteoblastic activity, and the fourth stage is the degeneration of the bone. This progression ultimately leads to softening and enlargement of bone, which makes patients prone to pathological fractures. One rare complication of Paget disease is osteosarcoma, which can be deadly in patients. Histologically, there is typically a hypercellularity of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, with the osteoclasts normally having a very large number of nuclei (can reach up to 100) and intracytoplasmic inclusions.

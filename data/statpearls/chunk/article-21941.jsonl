As the fovea is responsible for high-acuity vision it is densely saturated with cone photoreceptors. [5] The macula is about 5.5 mm in diameter, while the fovea is 0.35 mm in diameter. Furthermore, the fovea has about 50 cone cells per 100 micrometers squared and has an elliptical shape horizontally. Given this high cellular concentration, it is expectedly the location of the highest visual acuity, or resolution, in the eye. A unique feature of the central fovea is the displacement of other retinal layers concentrically, which allows for the highly efficient packing of cones. This is well visualized on standard optical coherence tomography (OCT) that can characterize foveal thickness. Normally, this measure is in the range of 200 microns. [6] Resolution or sharpness in vision is the shortest distance between 2 points in which the 2 points can still be distinguished as 2 separate dots. The main reason a person moves their head and eyes to focus on something is that they are placing the image on the fovea centralis.

AMD is a degenerative disorder of the retina that affects the macula lutea. Individuals with AMD retain their peripheral vision but lose their central vision, which manifests as scotomas and metamorphopsias. Despite the loss of photoreceptors within the fovea, the retina has an innate ability to use the remaining photoreceptors in the most effective manner possible. The retina creates a pseudo fovea, which is a fixation point that stabilizes vision. AMD is the most common cause of blindness for people older than the age of 75, affecting over 13 million Americans. The majority of cases are \u201cdry\u201d or nonexudative, which presents as a gradual loss of central vision. A classic finding on the exam with dry AMD is drusen, which is a yellow extracellular material that deposits between Bruch\u2019s membrane and the retinal pigment epithelium. There is no proven effective treatment or prevention of dry AMD. On the other hand, exudative, or \u201cwet\u201d, AMD does have effective treatments to slow or halt the progression of the disease. Wet AMD is characterized by choroidal neovascularization that can lead to rapid loss of vision due to bleeding. Standard treatment of wet AMD involves serial anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections to stop choroidal neovascularization and promote macular healing. Risk factors for AMD have been identified and include age, ethnicity, smoking, alcohol use, diet, family history, and certain chronic medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease or myeloproliferative disorders.

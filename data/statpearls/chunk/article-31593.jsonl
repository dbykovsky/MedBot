Vasculogenesis occurs when bone-marrow-derived endothelial precursor cells (EPCs) migrate to damaged tissue to differentiate and grow into new vessels. Though not the focus of this article, it is worth briefly noting that HBOT increases the rate of vasculogenesis via its upregulation of nitric oxide, causing the bone marrow to produce greater numbers of EPCs. Angiogenesis, in contrast to vasculogenesis, is blood vessel growth that occurs as new vessels bud off from existing blood vessels.

As part of the hemostatic process of wound healing, capillaries vasoconstrict, which increases the diffusion distance that oxygen must traverse to reach the endothelial cells.

Areas of the body with lower oxygen tension, such as the extremities and trunk, heal more slowly than facial wounds owing to lower oxygen tension. Moreover, it is these tissues (subcutaneous, fascial, tendon, and bone) that are at the most risk of poor wound healing. HOBT mitigates the risk by widening the oxygen partial pressure gradient to increase diffusion distance.

Until angiogenesis occurs, the oxygen tension in the graft is low, and sustained low oxygen tension caused by ischemia is a common etiology of graft compromise.

[24] Metastatic scirrhous breast cancer generally causes enophthalmos of the affected eye, as opposed to the classical space-occupying mass effect of most metastatic disease, and can often be the first clinical sign of breast carcinoma. [24] [25] Fibrotic infiltration of the orbital soft tissue in scirrhous metastatic breast disease causes retraction with fibrosis of the orbital tissues. It is thought that the other mechanism involved is one of fat atrophy where the metastatic cells replace orbital fat and promote the deposition of collagen with resultant contraction of the soft tissue inducing atrophy and eventual\u00a0necrosis. Breast metastatic disease should always be considered in middle-aged women who present with unilateral or bilateral enophthalmos in the absence of trauma or other diseases. An ophthalmic examination, examination of the breasts, and imaging of the orbits are obtained. \u00a0MRI is the best modality for diagnosing metastatic breast carcinoma. [26] In an aging population and with improved imaging and more widespread use of imaging, orbital metastases are being increasingly recognized. In the presence of new enophthalmos, especially when there is a restrictive pattern of ocular motility reduction, it is important to consider metastatic disease as a possibility. A biopsy of the lesion is required to confirm a diagnosis, followed by PET/CT to investigate the locations of metastatic disease. [27]"}

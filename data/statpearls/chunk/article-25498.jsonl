The two most common findings will be altered mental status and hypothermia, along with common findings of hypothyroidism. Other common signs include hyponatremia, hypotension, bradycardia, and hypoventilation. Laboratory results in primary hypothyroidism will show severely low or undetected low serum total T4, free T4, free T3, and elevated TSH. The underlying etiology for most patients is a primary thyroid failure, but secondary, tertiary, and sick euthyroid should be in the differential diagnosis. [48] In euthyroid sick syndrome, TSH will not be as elevated as expected. In a small percentage of patients, central hypothyroidism should be a consideration. In these patients, TSH may be inappropriately low. The method to distinguish central versus primary hypothyroidism is that the associated pituitary hormones will decrease as well. [22]"}

Acetohydroxamic acid (AHA ) is a urease inhibitor that has been shown to decrease struvite stone growth\u00a0and recurrence rates. [30] [31] AHA has no direct acidifying effect, and it is not an antibiotic. It should be used together with culture-specific antibiotics and is often synergistic with them. It has a high renal clearance and can easily pass through bacterial cell walls.\u00a0 AHA will decrease urinary alkalinity and lower urinary ammonia levels through its effect on blocking the hydrolysis of urea. The usual dose is 250-500 mg TID. It can be safely used in patients with mild renal failure at a reduced rate but should not be used where serum creatinine levels are above 2.5 mg/dL due to increased toxicity and reduced efficacy.

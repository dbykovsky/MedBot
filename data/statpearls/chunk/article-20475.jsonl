Multidetector CT with 64-slice or greater provides higher resolution with multiplanar reconstructions in the axial, coronal, and sagittal views. They are performed with double or triple (oral, intravenous, rectal) contrast dye with the potential for CT tractography, which has revolutionized the approach to diagnosing traumatic diaphragm injuries. [5] Where conventional CT fell short with low sensitivity, 64-slice or higher MDCT has improved sensitivity between 73% to 100% with specificity between 75% to 100%. [11] When TDIs are broken down further into blunt traumatic diaphragm rupture and penetrating traumatic diaphragm injury, MDCT yields better results in diagnosing blunt traumatic diaphragm injuries. This is attributed to the fact that blunt TDIs tend to be large and hence, easier to diagnose. Penetrating TDIs tend to be exceedingly small (1-2 cm), where the widely accepted radiographic signs accompanying diaphragm injury are generally absent. [4] [5] [7] [15] The choice to proceed with MDCT imaging is at the discretion of the trauma surgeon but generally is reserved for hemodynamically stable patients. Multiple radiographic signs have been studied and are used in the practice of reading and detecting diaphragmatic injuries. They can be broken down into direct and indirect signs."}

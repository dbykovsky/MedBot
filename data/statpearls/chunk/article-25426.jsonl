The key to successful therapy is close monitoring for disease worsening and drug-related toxicity. Patients should be followed once every two months while on therapy. Introduce one drug at a time and a lower dose and increase to a therapeutic dose over two to five days. Therapeutic drug monitoring is of no proven value. Azithromycin peak levels can be measured in the setting of malabsorption or treatment failure or if the dose is considered to be low. A peak level of greater than 0.4 mcg/mL was independently associated with the favorable microbiologic response. Rifampin can decrease macrolide levels. A study by Koh WJ et al. in 101 patients showed no correlation between clarithromycin level and favorable microbiologic response."}

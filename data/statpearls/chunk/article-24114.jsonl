Achieving meticulous hemostasis at both the inset and donor sites is crucial to prevent hematoma development. In the case of a muscle-only flap transfer, it should be covered with split-thickness skin grafts and a bolster. Ideally, the donor site should be closed primarily; however, significant subcutaneous undermining may be necessary for advancement and closure, especially with large skin paddle transfers. If primary closure of the donor site is not feasible, the remaining open wound can be covered with split-thickness skin grafts and a bolster. After pedicled latissimus transfer, the patient is often placed in an arm sling to restrict shoulder and arm movement on the flap side during the initial healing phase."}

Leeches aid in flap salvage by directly removing venous blood and secreting hirudin, which is a natural anticoagulant that inhibits thrombin from converting fibrinogen to fibrin and activating platelets.

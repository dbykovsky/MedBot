National guidelines for mass screening differ from country to country, and in regions with a low prevalence of H pylori infection, most guidelines advise against mass screening. [37] In some cases, 'screen-and-treat' strategies are recommended for communities at high risk of gastric cancer and are generally considered cost-effective in these regions. A substantial population-based screen-and-treat trial conducted in a high-incidence rural area of China demonstrated good compliance and the feasibility of this approach. However, it is noteworthy that long-term follow-up data regarding its efficacy in preventing gastric cancer are still pending. [50]", "contents": "Gastritis -- Deterrence and Patient Education.

For instance, in a placebo-controlled trial involving healthy volunteers, the use of clarithromycin at a dosage of 500 mg twice daily for the shortest recommended duration of 7 days for H pylori eradication has been shown to increase the resistance of macrolide-resistant pharyngeal Streptococcus pneumoniae . [50] Expert guidelines strongly discourage the use of antibiotics commonly used for treating life-threatening infections, including macrolides, penicillins, and fluoroquinolones, to eradicate H pylori in gastritis treatment. When strategizing public health campaigns to eradicate H pylori , it is recommended to consider medications such as bismuth, tetracycline, and metronidazole. Rifabutin may also be contemplated, as short-term usage of this agent is unlikely to contribute significantly to mycobacterial resistance against it.

CTS is most commonly seen in patients over 40 years of age and has a greater prevalence in females. Females comprise approximately 65% to 75% of all reported cases [1] . CTS results from compression of the median nerve within the carpal tunnel in the wrist. [2] Typically the pressure within the carpal tunnel in these patients can be 32 to 110 mm Hg compared to 2 to 31 mm Hg in normal patients. [3] The compression of the median nerve causes the classic pain distribution and/or parathesiass seen in CTS on the palmar aspect of the hand. The classic distribution invloves the area innervated by the median nerve to include the volar aspect of the thumb, index finger, long finger, and the radial volar half of the ring finger.\u00a0 Risk factors for the development of CTS include obesity, pregnancy (especially later in pregnancy), age, trauma to the wrist, and inflammatory rheumatic disorders.

The outermost layer, the epidermis, contains multiple layers and significant cell components such as melanocytes and keratinocytes. Underneath the epidermis lies the dermis, which consists of the superficial papillary dermis and deep reticular dermis. The papillary dermis is thin and comprises capillaries and various connective tissues like elastin, mainly collagen type III, and reticular fibers. The reticular dermis is more dense and contains more organized elastin, collagen type I and III, and larger blood vessels than the papillary dermis. The epidermis primarily acts as a protective layer that prevents fluid loss, while the dermis provides skin elasticity and strength. [7]", "contents": "Burn Classification -- Clinical Significance.

Subtotal thyroidectomy is utilized for long-term control of hyperthyroidism. Preparation of the patient for a subtotal thyroidectomy includes pretreatment with methimazole to achieve a nearly euthyroid status. Supersaturated potassium iodide is then added daily approximately two weeks before surgery and discontinued postoperatively. Alternatively, atenolol can be started 1 to 2 weeks before surgery to reduce resting heart rate. Supersaturated potassium iodide is also dosed and discontinued postoperatively. The rationale behind these management plans is to reduce complications associated with perioperative exacerbation of hyperthyroidism."}

One study reviewed the electro-clinical features of Lafora disease among patients with mutations in EPM2A and NHLRC1 genes during the late stage of Lafora disease. All patients manifested with gait ataxia, becoming bedbound with severe dementia. Associated daily symptoms of myoclonus include drug-resistant myoclonic seizures, myoclonic absence, and tonic-clonic seizures with EEG and polygraphic findings revealing diffusely slow activity with epileptiform abnormalities, usually associated with myoclonic jerks. Dominant features are seizure emergencies with motor cluster status epilepticus and medical complications. Other significant complications identified include dysphagia, aspiration pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, sepsis, immobility, and spasticity with bedsores. [29]"}

Neurologists and pediatricians lead patient management, focusing on supportive care for seizures. Pharmacists educate caregivers on the adverse effects of medications and compliance. Nurses play a crucial role in follow-ups, monitoring compliance, and identifying adverse reactions. Dietary consults may offer additional support, while geneticists provide counseling on screening for affected family members.

It is recommended to\u00a0start deferoxamine or oral chelators when\u00a0serum ferritin is more than 1000 ng/L. [18] Iron overload, if left untreated could result in unresponsiveness of pyridoxine. Therefore it is also recommended that patients with normal hemoglobin levels after pyridoxine should get phlebotomy as\u00a0a treatment for iron overload. [19] Iron overload treatment is very important as studies have shown an improvement in anemia due to low iron levels and better responsiveness to pyridoxine. [20]"}

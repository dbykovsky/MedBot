It mostly occurs in patients with ST-elevation MI. Other causes, such as infections and trauma, are also responsible. Diagnosis is markedly facilitated by a high index of suspicion and transthoracic echocardiography. Surgical intervention (Oxford CEBM level of evidence III) is the definitive treatment, and medical treatment includes fluids, inotropes, and vasopressors. American College of Cardiology highlights that making the diagnosis early is important, and the threshold for suspicion needs to be low.

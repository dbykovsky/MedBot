Skin tissue engineering is an evolving field of burn surgery with the end goal of creating a new and living tissue that fully replaces human skin. The engineering of skin tissues is difficult, and there must be good vascularization, specific-programmed migration of cells to stay within the wound, and appropriate tissue strength for biomaterials to improve wound healing and promote skin regeneration. Collagen and hyaluronic acid have been incorporated into sponges, films, gels, and matrices in many agents. Collagen promotes the adherence and growth of keratinocytes and fibroblasts, which promote wound healing. Hyaluronic acid is an essential component of the skin extracellular matrix that assists in wound repair. Elastin is involved in providing the scaffolding and cell mediating functions in human skin. Skin substitute products containing elastin allow for one-step procedures of skin grafting and improved skin graft incorporation. Two-stage procedures are commonly employed with the application of a skin substitute that must be incorporated into the wound over time, then followed by split-thickness skin grafting. [5] [13]"}

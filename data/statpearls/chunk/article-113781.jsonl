Infants with short bowel syndrome often have increased fluid losses; therefore are at higher risk of zinc deficiency. Premature infants need higher doses of zinc secondary to their rapid growth.\u00a0Zinc deficiency can result from congenital or nutritional causes. Congenital abnormality of zinc absorption or transport results in acrodermatitis enteropathica affecting skin, hair, and nails, and patients present with FTT, hair loss, diarrhea, dermatitis, facial rash, and nail hypoplasia. Acquired/ nutritional deficiency of zinc is commonly seen in preterm infants on PN, resulting in growth failure, poor wound healing, skin rashes, and iron deficiency anemia as zinc is a cofactor in iron metabolism.

The financial impact of using donor milk is quite significant, accounting for the slow adoption in the poorer countries. The quality of the donated breastmilk varies widely from person to person. [34] Hence most centers typically use pooled donor breastmilk from multiple donors in different stages of breastfeeding, intended to limit variation in the quality of breastmilk. [35] This donor breastmilk is usually processed by centralized milk banks after screening the donors and milk samples for communicable diseases (HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, etc.). In addition, the milk is usually sterilized by pasteurization. Most donor milk banks also require negative drug screens from the women, and the milk is screened before pooling. The processed milk is frozen using a cold-chain until it is ready to be used at the bedside. Individual institutions often have their written policy on the use of donor breastmilk."}

While donor breastmilk is a valuable resource in the care of preterm infants, newer studies show the benefits of mother's own milk (MOM) over donor breastmilk. It is theorized that pooled pasteurized donor breastmilk has less immunogenic value due to the loss of immunoglobulins and cells during processing. Nevertheless, donor breastmilk is still regarded as superior to commercial preterm formulas,\u00a0and an increasing number of neonatal intensive care units are now using donor breastmilk in their preterm infants. A survey of NICUs in the USA showed that about 45% of the NICUs are using donor breastmilk in infants up to 1800 g. [36] The DOMINO trial group studied the neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm infants <1500 g comparing the use of donor milk versus preterm formula, which showed no differences in cognitive or neurodevelopmental scores at 18 months. [37] [38] Besides, the rate of NEC was reduced from 11% to 2% in this study. Donor milk is recommended to be stopped before 36 weeks corrected age as it is too low in folate and Vitamin C (DOMINO group recommendations).

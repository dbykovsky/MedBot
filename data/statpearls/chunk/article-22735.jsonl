The conjunctival vessels lie at the ocular surface and may bleed spontaneously or after eye-rubbing, usually causing subconjunctival hemorrhage. Subconjunctival hemorrhage without a breach in the conjunctiva is often not associated with frank blood in tears, though red blood corpuscles may be seen on microscopic examination of tears. [1] Causes of haemolacria due to the involvement of the conjunctiva\u00a0 include Trauma - Conjunctival laceration or rupture of conjunctival vessels may cause hemolacria. Surgery involving incision or excision of the conjunctiva may also cause hemolacria. The surgeries include small incision cataract surgery, pterygium surgery, squint surgery, scleral buckling, trabeculectomy, pars plana vitrectomy, and other ocular surgeries.\u00a0After manipulation of the conjunctival follicle in trachoma, there may be haemolacria. Inflammation - Severe conjunctivitis including hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, membranous or pseudomembranous conjunctivitis, follicular conjunctivitis with congested semilunar fold and caruncle, severe viral or bacterial conjunctivitis cause blood-stained tears. Conjunctival ulcers or granulation due to various reasons may cause haemolacria. Postoperative sclera buckle infection can also cause bloody tears. Vascular lesions - Hemangioma, lymphangioma, inflammatory papilloma of the conjunctival sac, telangiectasia of conjunctival vessels, pyogenic granuloma, [2] conjunctival varies, pathological vasodilation of the conjunctival vessels, severely vascular papillae, giant papillary conjunctivitis may bleed leading to bloody tears. Malignant melanoma of the conjunctiva may be associated with haemolacria. Vicarious menstruation - The conjunctiva may periodically/cyclically bleed (vicarious menstruation) during menstruation or hormonal disturbances. This phenomenon is usually seen around menarche or rarely around the menopause. Sir Duke-Elder proposed that 'instability of the nervous system' and not hormonal disturbance is the cause of vicarious menstruation from the conjunctiva. [3] The source of blood in hemolacria in vicarious menstruation\u00a0has been thought to be the\u00a0lacrimal gland, lower forniceal conjunctiva, episclera, dilation of forniceal, and bulbar conjunctival vessels, and hemorrhages in upper tarsal conjunctiva. The ophthalmic examination may be normal with normal-appearing conjunctiva in some cases. Vicarious menstruation may cause a subconjunctival hemorrhage. The vicarious menstruation is usually painless, may last for seconds to minutes, and may involve one or both eyes. Islands of ectopic endometrial tissue may be present outside the uterus. This is called endometriosis, and such aberrant endometrial tissue in conjunctiva may cause vicarious menstruation. Primary localized conjunctival amyloidosis may cause recurrent subconjunctival bleed due to vicarious menstruation. [4] Other possible explanations of vicarious menstruation include [1] : Normal conjunctiva stimulated by hormonal or other factors. Estrogenic premenstrual light blood hypertension. Foreign body - Foreign body at the upper fornix can cause chronic irritation, erosion of the conjunctiva, and hemolacria.

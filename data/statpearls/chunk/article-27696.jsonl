Stage 3: Full-thickness tissue loss. Subcutaneous fat might be evident, and tissue damage involving muscular layers is predicted. Further characteristics of this stage are tissue undermining and tunneling. [5] [12] Stage 4: Physical examination reveals a\u00a0full-thickness tissue loss with\u00a0bone, tendon, or joint involvement. Unstageable: The base of ulcer coverage with either tissue sloughing or eschar formation prevents a discrete classification. Deep tissue pressure injury: There is presence of a localized purple or maroon discoloration due to either a pressure or a shear injury and a blister full of blood."}

This can include local wound infection as well as soft tissue infection, osteomyelitis, and bacteremia. Osteomyelitis can manifest as a wound with delayed healing and does not always include systemic signs such as sepsis or leukocytosis. Bacteremia is usually more apparent as signs of a systemic inflammatory response typically accompany it. Evaluation of pressure injuries for infection can require a combination of clinical assessment and judgment, microbiological and histopathological evaluation, and imaging studies. The infection control goals include preventing the spread of pathogens to other patients, staff, and the surrounding environment and avoiding the selection of resistant microorganisms.

ACP clinical practice guidelines from 2015 advise performing a risk assessment to recognize patients at risk of pressure injury formation. [21] Several scales have been created to predict the risk of pressure injuries to identify patients for whom prevention measures or early treatment should be considered. The most commonly used tools for this are the Braden and Norton scales. Reducing external forces includes minimizing extrinsic risk factors, such as friction, shear, pressure, and moisture, which is important for deterring pressure injury formation. Evidence has demonstrated that educating providers and patients can lead to a decrease in the incidence of pressure injuries and an increase in the ability to manage them.

The prognosis of diplopia is very variable and depends entirely on the underlying condition that is causing it. Benign cases may be chronic and will need surgical correction. Diplopia may be corrected in cases where the underlying condition is treated, as in most cases of myasthenia gravis and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 variants. Lesions in the brainstem (small strokes) may improve over time."}

However, because there are many causes of diplopia and the workup is beyond the scope of the primary provider, these patients should be referred to an ophthalmologist and preferably to a neuro-ophthalmologist for definitive diagnosis and treatment planning.

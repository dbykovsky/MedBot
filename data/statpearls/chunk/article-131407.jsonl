Have the patient positioned on their side and obtain a lateral view of the foot with the sesamoids clearly visible. On static X-ray, proximal migration of the sesamoids may be visible. To assess under fluoroscopy, take images with the great toe at neutral, then apply dorsiflexion stress to the great toe keeping the foot and first metatarsal static. The normal sesamoid\u00a0function is distal migration with dorsiflexion of the great toe. When there is a plantar plate tear, the sesamoids will not move distally and either stay in place or move proximally. [7]"}

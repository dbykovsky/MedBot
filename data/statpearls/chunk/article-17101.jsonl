Tetracyclines, in particular, have anti-inflammatory properties, making them the preferred antibiotic for treating acne vulgaris. If tetracyclines are ineffective or not well-tolerated by patients, other antibiotics (such as macrolides, cephalosporins, penicillins, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) may be considered alternatives. [41] To reduce the development of antibiotic resistance, it is necessary to limit the duration of the treatment to the shortest possible period (ideally, 3-4 months). This can be complemented by the concurrent use of a topical retinoid, which can aid in the discontinuation of the antibiotic, or by incorporating the use of benzoyl peroxide. Preferred tetracyclines for acne treatment include doxycycline, minocycline, and sarecycline. Doxycycline and other tetracyclines should not be prescribed to patients who are children aged less than 8 or pregnant women. Long-term treatment with oral antibiotics may lead to tooth discoloration in developing teeth. Moreover, doxycycline can cause gastrointestinal distress, esophagitis, and pseudotumor cerebri (idiopathic intracranial hypertension). Photosensitivity is also one of the\u00a0adverse effects of oral antibiotics; therefore, sun protective measures are advised while on treatment with tetracyclines."}

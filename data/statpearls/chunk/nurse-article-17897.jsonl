The aspirated fluid can be oropharyngeal secretions, particulate matter, or gastric content. Aspiration pneumonia requires high bacterial content in the aspirated fluid. If the inhaled fluid is sterile, as is the case with gastric fluid that becomes devoid of bacterial colonies due to its low pH, aspiration pneumonitis occurs. Aspiration pneumonitis is a chemical injury that does not require antibiotic therapy. In contrast, aspiration pneumonia will not resolve without appropriate antibiotic therapy. The mortality rate from aspiration pneumonia is largely dependent on the volume and content of aspirate and can range up to 70%.

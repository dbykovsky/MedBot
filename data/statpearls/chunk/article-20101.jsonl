The overall survival rate of craniopharyngiomas is 80 to 95% at 5 years. The prognosis is good in young individuals and poor for individuals over the age of 65. Females tend to have additional morbidity that includes stroke, adverse cardiac events, and psychosocial deficits.", "contents": "Craniopharyngioma -- Prognosis.

There are two histologic subtypes, adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma (ACP) and papillary craniopharyngioma (PCP). Both of these have different age distribution, MRI appearances, and somatic mutations. The treatment of craniopharyngiomas is primarily surgery and radiotherapy.

It is continuous with the epiconus (L4 to S1 segments) superiorly and consists of S2 to S5 as well as the coccygeal segments. [4] The pia mater of the tapering end of the conus continues downward as the filum terminale, which is a delicate strand of fibrous tissue about 20 cm in length. This structure serves to stabilize the spinal cord by connecting the conus to the coccyx via the coccygeal ligament. The lumbosacral nerve roots continue inferiorly to this as the cauda equina. On average, the conus terminates at the middle third of the L1 vertebra but can be located as high as the middle third of the T11 vertebra or as low as the middle third of L3 vertebra. On cross-section, the left and right halves are found to be separated by the ventral median fissure and posterior median sulcus. According to Grogan et al., on computed tomogram (CT) imaging, the conus appears oval in shape, with an anterior sulcus and posterior promontory. [5] The length of the anteroposterior diameter is 5 to 8 mm, and that of the transverse diameter is 8 to 11 mm. The ventriculus terminalis or the fifth ventricle is an incidentally found asymptomatic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) containing ependymal lined cavity within the conus which is formed during embryogenesis and regresses in early childhood.

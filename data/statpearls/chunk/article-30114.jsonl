Hepatic injury after hepatic stress results from several mechanisms, including inflammation and microcirculatory disturbance.\u00a0Levels of thromboxane have been shown\u00a0to\u00a0increase\u00a0in the systemic circulation after different\u00a0types of\u00a0hepatic stress such as endotoxemia, hepatic ischemia-reperfusion, hepatectomy, liver transplantation, hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation, hepatic cirrhosis, and alcoholic liver injury.\u00a0The production of thromboxane from the liver also becomes enhanced\u00a0under these stresses. Thromboxane induces hepatic damage through vasoconstriction, platelet aggregation, induction of leukocyte adhesion, up-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines, and release of other vasoconstrictors.

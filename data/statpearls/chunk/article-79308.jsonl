The authors indicate that treatment requires amelioration of biological and psychological aspects and that both processes must occur to lead to remission. The remission of the biological aspect consists of the dampening of mesolimbic dopamine release with antipsychotic medication. This reduced dopaminergic activity decreases the uneven salience and attribution of personalized meaning to surrounding stimuli. With the decrease in salience intensity, the person can reassess the stimuli and more accurately distribute attention, reducing the level of over-personalized meaning and leading to a more realistic appraisal of the situation. The therapist can attempt to \"shake\" the once \"unshakable\" delusion as insight improves. [44] Psychological remission consists of the reappraisal of primary psychotic experiences. Both remission forms are partially independent, and shifts in both areas are required to remission symptoms. [45]", "contents": "Delusions -- Treatment / Management.

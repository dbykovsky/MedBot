Treatments reported for some inpatient cases include systemic corticosteroids, cyclosporine, acitretin, dapsone, infliximab, and intravenous immune globulin (IVIG). [4] In cases of severe or refractory AGEP, there may be a role for systemic steroids or cyclosporine, with the potential to escalate to infliximab and intravenous immune globulin; however, these treatments are not routinely indicated. Evidence-based guidelines for AGEP that fail to respond to supportive therapy do not yet exist, as current recommendations are based on case studies without controlled studies. [5] For patients with a history of AGEP, empiric avoidance of the suspected trigger and appropriate documentation of an adverse drug reaction history in the patient\u2019s medical record is appropriate.

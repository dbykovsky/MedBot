The epidemiology is also similar, with the addition of avid runners, and people with low BMIs. An X-ray is the first-line, but inconclusive imaging modality. X-rays often miss stress fractures, especially in the initial inflammatory period. The patient can\u00a0undergo another X-ray after 2 to 3 weeks, or if an urgent diagnosis is needed, they can opt for an MRI. An MRI is the most sensitive imaging modality for tibial stress fractures and can aid in excluding other pathologies like\u00a0acute compartment syndrome. [25] [31] Bone scintigram scan can also be performed to highlight a stress fracture. The conservative management for stress fractures is the same as shin splints. However, patients are to refrain from running or stressful activities to the leg for 6 to 8 weeks. Patients may also wear a pneumatic brace when they return to activity.

Decorticate Posturing). This condition leads to the flexion of the upper extremities and extension of the lower extremities with painful stimuli. [17] The injury to the red nucleus causes subsequent overactivation of the rubrospinal tract and medullary reticulospinal tract. Also, the lateral corticospinal tract is disturbed, which causes flexor muscles of the lower extremities to be impaired and allows the pontine reticulospinal and medial and lateral vestibulospinal to induce biased extension.", "contents": "Neuroanatomy, Extrapyramidal System -- Clinical Significance -- Decorticate Rigidity.

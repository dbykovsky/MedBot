Patients with navicular fractures typically experienced pain in the midfoot area that could be associated with an inflammatory process. The navicular stress fracture could mostly be managed nonsurgically by immobilization and protected weight-bearing for a six to eight weeks period. However, in an athlete with a high functioning demand, operative intervention to repair by open reduction and internal fixation become a beneficial option. On the other hand, traumatic navicular fracture typically requires surgical intervention, especially if a displaced navicular body fracture occurred.

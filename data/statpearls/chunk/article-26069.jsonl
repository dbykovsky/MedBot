Therefore, seeking consultation with a highly skilled and experienced therapist in administering this specialized form of therapy is crucial. Medical consultations may vary depending on the severity and specific nature of the compulsions exhibited. For instance, if a patient engages in excessive hand-washing, dermatological issues like dermatitis may arise, necessitating consultation with a dermatologist. Comprehensive treatment should address the patient holistically, encompassing psychological symptoms and any resulting medical conditions. Coordination of care with other healthcare clinicians (eg, pediatrics or family medicine) is also vital, especially for monitoring potential side effects of medications, including weight gain and tics.", "contents": "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder -- Consultations.

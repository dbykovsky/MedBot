The\u00a0blood flow through the retinal artery is slow and can be visualized by the movement of the\u00a0segments of blood\u00a0during the slit-lamp biomicroscopic examination using a 90D lens. The slow blood flow through the arterioles is also prominently observed\u00a0during fluorescein angiography.\u00a0In this procedure, the dye filling of the arteriole progresses slowly. This observation is better appreciated by comparing early images of the involved eye taken in rapid succession or using video angiography.

Cilioretinal arteries\u00a0arising from short posterior ciliary arteries are present in around 15% to 25% of patients, and these typically supply the fovea. Thus, in CRAO with the patent cilioretinal artery (cilioretinal artery sparing), the central vision may be maintained. However, the visual field is severely reduced (see Image . Central Retinal Artery Occlusion with Cilioretinal Artery Sparing). Typically, no retinal hemorrhage of retinal venous dilation and tortuosity occurs, as noted in central retinal venous occlusion.

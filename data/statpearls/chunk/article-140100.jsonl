The other alternative recommended by the infectious disease society of America (IDSA) is fluconazole. The recommended dose is 400-800 mg per day. Hamada et al. recommended fluconazole as the first-line therapy because of its better side effect profile than AMB. In severe cases with non-resolving vitritis, pars plana vitrectomy is the treatment of choice. The treatment duration depends on the clinical picture, but a minimum of 6 weeks is recommended.

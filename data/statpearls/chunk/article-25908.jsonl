While immunocompromised individuals are at greatest risk, immunocompetent individuals are also at risk for infection, particularly the cutaneous form of the infection. The main etiology of infection in these patients is due to a skin lesion that was contaminated with organic matter or soil.\u00a0 Therefore,\u00a0a key way to lower the risk of cutaneous nocardiosis is to wear closed shoes and gloves when working in hazardous areas (construction sites, gardens, etc.). If a skin lesion is sustained, it is important to clean the wound thoroughly. If the area becomes red, swollen, and warm or if there is purulent drainage,\u00a0a primary care clinician should be consulted.

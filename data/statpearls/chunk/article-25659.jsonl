A reduction in interburst intervals to <15 sec at 32 weeks and <10 sec at 34 weeks can also be noted. After 32 weeks, delta burst activity increases in\u00a0frequency, approximately 1 to 2 Hz, but shows a reduction in amplitude, becoming\u00a0exuberant or profuse by 34 weeks. Delta brush activity remains localized\u00a0to the occipital at 34 weeks gestation. Theta activity seen in earlier gestational ages disappears in AS at 32 weeks. Additionally, immature, poorly defined frontal sharp transients may show up by 34 weeks gestation. [17]"}

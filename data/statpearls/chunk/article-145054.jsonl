The entire healthcare team plays a vital role in measuring for, fitting,\u00a0and developing spectacles, contact lenses, and other ophthalmic optical devices with the ideal corrective refraction. Fitting spectacles properly centered over the eyes for ideal vision is an important task performed by opticians, nurses, and other interprofessional team members. Understanding optical power and the principles of positive and negative lenses ensures the avoidance of simple mistakes in spectacle fit and prescription. The lensmaker formula measures optical power in diopters, which opticians and optical technologists can use to understand patient-specific vision needs,\u00a0including the adjustment of additive lenses should the patient need additional power for activities like reading."}

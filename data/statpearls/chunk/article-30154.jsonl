The radioactive tracer is administered into the patient, and a probe measures the amount of iodine uptake by the thyroid gland. The thyroid scan checks for the even spread of the tracer in the gland.

I-131 has a longer half-life than I-123, so I-123 is used more frequently than I-131 due to less radiation exposure to the body. 99m-Technetium pertechnetate is an analog of iodine, so it gets transported to the thyroid gland similarly to iodine.\u00a0111In-pentoxide, thallium-201 (201T1),\u00a099mTc-sestamibi, 99mTc-tetrofosmin are some of the less commonly used radioactive tracers in this test.

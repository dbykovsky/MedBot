A recently published study exploring the PICC-related\u00a0complications in 3,285 patients reported that central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) and symptomatic DVT were the most common complications. Most of the CLABSIs were monomicrobial and caused by gram-positive bacteria. [23] A study by Nasia et al concluded that the PICC-associated bloodstream infection rate was 2.4% or 2 to 5 per 1000 catheter days. [24] This rate was similar in another study on ICU patients comparing CVCs with PICCs. PICCs were associated with an infection rate of 2.2 per 1000 catheter days versus 6 per 1000 catheter days for CVCs. [25] These rates were significantly higher than patients with a PICC receiving outpatient care at 0.4 per 1000 catheter days. [24]"}

[26] When comparing PICC and tunneled\u00a0CVCs for TPN administration, PICC was associated with a significantly lower rate of CRBSI. [27] The primary pathway for infection is the migration of skin organisms at the insertion site into the cutaneous catheter tract, leading to the colonization of the catheter tip.

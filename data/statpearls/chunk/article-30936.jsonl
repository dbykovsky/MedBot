In early pregnancy, all\u00a03 of these goals can typically be achieved with a pelvic ultrasound, and if an intrauterine pregnancy is not clearly identified on ultrasound, a quantitative serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level should be obtained; sometimes, the hCG level needs to be trended over time to make the correct diagnosis. The hCG level is typically unnecessary if a bedside ultrasound clearly demonstrates an intrauterine embryo/fetus with visible fetal cardiac activity (FCA). If, however, FCA has not yet been detected, a serum hCG level is indicated. Since an hCG level can help radiologists interpret ultrasound findings before the development of FCA,\u00a0it is usually prudent to obtain the hCG level before ordering a formal pelvic ultrasound.

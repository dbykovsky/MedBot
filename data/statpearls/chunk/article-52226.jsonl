Complications in the immediate period during and after transplantation, such as infections, organ injury from the conditioning regimen, and acute\u00a0GVHD, are usually managed by the transplant team with protocols similar to those used in patients receiving HSCT for other indications. However, more long-term complications, such as late secondary malignancies, are often managed with close screening, the burden of which is shared between the transplant team and other health professionals. Infertility should be managed preemptively with counseling regarding fertility preservation options before the transplantation procedure."}

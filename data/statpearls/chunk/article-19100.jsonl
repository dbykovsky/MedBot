Subsequently, adhere to standard protocols for skin disinfection and draping. Administer a skin wheal by injecting a local anesthetic into the abdominal wall anterior to the T12 vertebral body. Then, proceed by inserting an appropriately designed spinal-type needle and directing it towards the abdominal aorta, which typically traverses through abdominal viscera, including the bowel, stomach, and liver. Ensure the final needle tip placement is anterior to the aorta and the diaphragmatic crura. Subsequently, introduce the neurolytic agent into the antecrural space.", "contents": "Celiac Plexus Block -- Technique or Treatment -- Anterior Para-Aortic Approach.

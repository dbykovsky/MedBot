Chronic PHM, also known as Lance-Adams syndrome (LAS), has a generally more favorable prognosis, owing at least in part to the usual absence of an underlying ischemic brain injury. LAS usually emerges on a subacute or chronic time scale, but emergence as early as the first 96 hours has been reported, which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty between PHM and LAS. EEG findings in LAS may feature spike-wave, poly-spike activity, or slow frequency waves; up to 50% of EEGs in LAS demonstrate focal epileptiform activity at the vertex, considered by some to be a defining feature of LAS.

EEG alone can advance the diagnostic reasoning in cases of myoclonic epilepsies. However, the most broadly informative approach combines EEG with electromyography (EMG) on muscles of interest. The technique of EEG-EMG back-averaging (correlation of electrical activity on EEG in the brain with muscle jerking on EMG) shows cortical discharge preceding the activity on electromyography. Even when the EEG has no clinical correlate, the absence of myoclonic cortical activity can be instructive, as in cases of subcortical-nonsegmental myoclonus (eg, propriospinal, brainstem reticular myoclonus, or myoclonus-dystonia). Evoked potentials can be helpful in some segmental or peripheral myoclonus cases, but they are not pathognomic."}

Perhaps most\u00a0pathognomonically\u00a0associated with \"startle myoclonus\" in Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, myoclonus can also be a feature of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson disease, frontotemporal dementia, and disorders of basal ganglia or spinocerebellar degeneration, among others. Inflammatory conditions\u2014infectious, post-infectious, antibody-mediated, or paraneoplastic\u2014often feature myoclonic jerks.

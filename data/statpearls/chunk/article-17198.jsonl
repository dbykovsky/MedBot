Meyer first described this mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue in 1868. The adenoids are midline structures situated on the roof and posterior wall of the nasopharynx. They form part of the Waldeyer ring, whose components include the adenoids, the palatine tonsils, and the lingual tonsils. They are present from the seventh month of gestation and typically grow until age 5. Adenoid tissue can be found extending to the eustachian tube opening and the fossa of Rosenmuller. The fossa of Rosenmuller is on the lateral wall of the nasopharynx, just behind the cartilage of the eustachian tube. These lymphoid masses have an important immunologic function, and hypertrophy can pose a risk for disease pathologies in children. Adenoids with other lymphatic tissue in the nasopharynx are the first line of defense against ingested or inhaled pathogens. [1] [2]", "contents": "Anatomy, Head and Neck: Adenoids -- Introduction.

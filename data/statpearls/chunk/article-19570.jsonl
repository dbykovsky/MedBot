Once recovery from blockade begins, from the evidence of peripheral nerve stimulation, the neuromuscular blockade may be reversed with an anticholinesterase agent (eg, neostigmine) in conjunction with an anticholinergic agent (eg, glycopyrrolate). As with other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents, the more full the neuromuscular blockade at the point of reversal, the longer the time required for recovery of neuromuscular function. A typical dose of neostigmine is 0.03 to 0.07 mg/kg, in conjunction with 0.2 mg glycopyrrolate for every 1 mg of neostigmine. [17]"}

{"id": "article-31363_1", "title": "Widened Mediastinum -- Issues of Concern", "content": "A widened mediastinum will often be first noted in the emergency department on a chest x-ray. The mediastinal borders are composed of the right heart, ascending aorta, superior vena cava, aortic knob, descending aorta, and the left heart. These structures are all contained between the right and left lungs. The mediastinum can be partitioned into three compartments from anterior to posterior, which is best viewed on the lateral film. The anterior compartment contains the heart, thyroid, and thymus. The middle mediastinal compartment includes the esophagus, trachea, and many lymph nodes. The posterior compartment is the paravertebral area and is primarily composed of the vertebral column. [1] The definition of a widened mediastinum is a measured mediastinal width greater than 6 to 8 cm, depending on which source you use. [2] This finding is very sensitive for major vascular injury in the setting of trauma but can have numerous additional associated pathologies, as noted above. Pathology causing a widened mediastinum may also compress or displace nearby structures, such as the trachea.", "contents": "Widened Mediastinum -- Issues of Concern.

The proper distance for taking a standard PA chest x-ray is with 6 feet between the x-ray source and the detector plate. If the distance between the detector plate and the x-ray source is closer than 6 feet, the structures in the film will appear larger and less sharp. Additionally, an AP chest x-ray, typically obtained as a portable chest x-ray, is taken at a closer distance and therefore also reveals larger and less sharp structures. \u00a0Patient positioning also plays an important role. If the patient is rotated or slouched, the mediastinum may appear falsely widened. After you have ensured the processing of an adequate film, the second consideration is to compare the chest x-ray to prior studies, if available. Typically, more chronic causes of a widened mediastinum, such as a mass or lymphadenopathy, cause focal widening, whereas acute causes of a widened mediastinum, like infection or bleeding, cause diffuse, generalized widening.

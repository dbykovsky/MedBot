As such, the pros and cons of palliative sedation should be clearly outlined to the patient/family to manage expectations. Excess sedation can theoretically cause an increased risk of aspiration pneumonia and respiratory suppression. However, contrary to this belief, recent studies have demonstrated that palliative sedation can be safely administered without any disproportionate increase in the incidence of aspiration pneumonia or respiratory failure. [34] [35] [34] Additionally, other studies have demonstrated that the time till death is not significantly shortened in patients receiving palliative sedation compared to patients receiving standard or alternative therapy.

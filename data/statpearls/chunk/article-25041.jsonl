Despite the thumb tolerating more angulation than other metacarpals due to\u00a0its higher mobility, an apex dorsal angulation of over 30 degrees often fares poorly with non-operative management. Indications for closed reduction and thumb spica casting include extra-articular fracture, less than 30 degrees of angulation following closed reduction, and non-displaced (or less than 1 mm displacement) of an intra-articular fracture (i.e., Bennet fracture). Intra-articular fractures (Bennett\u00a0\u2013\u00a02 part and Rolando\u00a0\u2013\u00a03 part fracture patterns) most commonly require surgical fixation. The joint surface must be reduced\u00a0to avoid long-term post-traumatic deformity and articular cartilage degeneration. [17] [29]"}

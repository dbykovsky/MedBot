Upon injury, the patient will be in severe pain that will typically subside quickly.\u00a0 Children will hold their arm on their lap or close against their body and refuse to use it.\u00a0 Treatment for elbow subluxation is non-invasive and can usually be done in an outpatient office by reducing the joint.\u00a0 There are two ways this is typically done.\u00a0 The first method is the supination flexion method. This is done by stabilizing the elbow with one arm while flexing the child\u2019s arm to the shoulder and supinating the arm simultaneously.\u00a0 You should feel the joint reduce with the stabilizing hand. [13] The patient will be in some discomfort until joint reduction completes.\u00a0 Another method gaining popularity is the hyperpronation method; in recent studies, it has been found the hyperpronation method may have higher first-time success rates.\u00a0 Upon reduction, the discomfort usually subsides completely but Tylenol may be used for pain relief.

Tumor lysis syndrome, which is the cytolysis of tumor cells causing hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia. [3] Calcium can precipitate in the kidneys, causing acute kidney injury (AKI). The flux of calcium, phosphate, and potassium is associated with cardiac arrhythmias, CNS toxicity, and death. Because TLS can occur before treatment is initiated, prophylaxis should be started promptly. Tumor lysis syndrome is more likely to occur in male patients, as well as patients with a history of renal disease, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or uric acid levels, or splenomegaly.

Uncertainty arises because the anatomic compression of the celiac artery by the median arcuate ligament can also be seen in asymptomatic patients. In other words, every patient with this anatomic compression does not develop symptoms. The median arcuate ligament is a fibrous band that connects the two medial borders of the diaphragmatic crura, usually near the level of the\u00a012th thoracic or first lumbar vertebra. Compression of the celiac artery can occur in two anatomic situations: an abnormally cephalad origin of the celiac artery or an abnormally caudad insertion of the diaphragm. Congenital factors may influence the level of the insertion of the diaphragm or the origin of the celiac artery. This hypothesis is supported by a small series of studies in families and monozygotic twins. The compression of the celiac artery by the median arcuate ligament is believed to cause intermittent mesenteric ischemia. However, this explanation alone may not completely explain the condition as there is usually a rich collateral network of mesenteric vessels between the celiac artery and the superior mesenteric artery. Therefore, there may be a role for underlying celiac nerve plexus dysfunction as well when considering the etiology of this condition. Nerve dysfunction may lead to abnormal splanchnic vasoconstriction, leading to ischemia. [2]", "contents": "Celiac Artery Compression Syndrome -- Etiology.

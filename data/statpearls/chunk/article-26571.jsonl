Large islet cell tumors may\u00a0have areas of cystic or necrotic nonenhancement. [43] MRI can further characterize cystic neoplasms. [44] IPMNs should show either main pancreatic ductal dilation (diffuse or segmental) or a multi-cystic lobulated mass. Mucinous cystic neoplasms appear congruent with simple cystic fluid collections that may have fluid-fluid levels on T2-weighted images. Postcontrast T1-weighted sequences may show enhancing mural nodules within the lesion. The main pancreatic duct is usually not involved. Serous cystadenoma will typically reveal numerous small cysts that are hyperintense on T2-weighted images. Thin septa may enhance, and if a central scar is present, it will enhance on delayed imaging. [18]"}

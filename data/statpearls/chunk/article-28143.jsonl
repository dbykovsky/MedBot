Pioneers such as Ignaz Semmelweis and Florence Nightingale were among the first in medicine to make changes to process based on observation and data collection. [20] [21] Semmelweis was a Hungarian physician who observed increased mortality in obstetric patients who were cared for by physicians versus those cared for by nurse-midwives within the same institution. It was not until one of his colleagues suffered an injury and death due to scalpel puncture while performing an autopsy that Semmelweis noted an association. He instituted a policy of handwashing after completing autopsies and prior to delivering babies, and, as a result, the mortality rate decreased substantially to a level similar to that of midwives. As for Florence Nightingale, an English nurse, she is known for her observation of poor healthcare conditions while serving the British army. She also was an advocate for the development of standardized, formal nursing education and was recognized as one of the earlier adopters of evidence-based medicine using data and data visualization.

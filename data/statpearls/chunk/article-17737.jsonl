Open arch replacement usually employs the use of a classical two-staged elephant trunk (ET) or a frozen elephant trunk (FET) procedure wherein the first stage is an open repair of the ascending aorta and aortic arch along with the placement of the trunk followed by a second stage completion surgery which involves the intervention of the descending aorta via either open or the endovascular approach using thoracic endovascular stent graft (TEVAR). Deployment of TEVAR is done in a retrograde fashion in the setting of ET, whereas ante-grade deployment through a reconstructed transverse arch is achieved in a FET procedure. Island patch reconstruction or branch graft is often used to anastomose supra-aortic branches, and brain protection during the surgery is provided by a deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA) or with newer strategies including antegrade and retrograde cerebral perfusion.

Due to its relatively low molecular mass, myoglobin may leak from muscle tissue into the bloodstream due to skeletal or cardiac muscle injury and then show up in the urine. [8] Myoglobinemia and myoglobinuria have been used in the diagnosis of myopathies and cardiomyopathies. [28] A pronounced increase in serum myoglobin is an early quantitative indicator of AMI. [5] It has been reported that myoglobinuria is a more sensitive clinical indicator of AMI than increased activities or concentrations of serum creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) isoenzyme, especially when blood samples are drawn in the early stage of the disease (e.g., within 3 hours after onset). [61] However, these assays are less specific because no assay can differentiate myocardial from skeletal muscle myoglobin. [62] Increased serum myoglobin concentrations return to normal sooner than\u00a0total CK and the CK-MB isoenzyme in AMI. [63] The faster elimination of myoglobin from the blood may be advantageous in the assessment of reinfarctions occurring during the period of increased enzyme activities. [64] Recurrent increases in serum myoglobin are thus suggestive of an extension of the original infarction. [65]"}

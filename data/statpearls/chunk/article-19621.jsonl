Inhibition of this receptor prevents the downstream activation of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor complex, which leads to reduced platelet aggregation. Clopidogrel is an inactive prodrug that requires enzymatic activation via a variety of CYP enzymes, including the CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 enzymes, through a two-step process of bioactivation. Genetic polymorphisms to these enzymes can influence response to therapy. The most commonly discussed genetic polymorphism related to clopidogrel is that of one or both alleles of the CYP2C19 enzyme. Patients with any loss of function allele will not effectively metabolize clopidogrel, leading to the inability to inhibit platelet activity. For example, patients who are homozygous for these non-functioning alleles often demonstrate the poorest metabolism and subsequent activation of clopidogrel, as indicated by high on-treatment platelet reactivity via platelet function testing.

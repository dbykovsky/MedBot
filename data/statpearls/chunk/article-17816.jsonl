The chart is a useful and inexpensive tool to monitor metamorphopsia and scotoma in various macular diseases, most commonly wet age-related macular degeneration. The Amsler-Dubois chart is an important chart to document posterior segment lesions, including retinal detachment. Dr. Amsler's research interests included the study of the macular function, the study of aqueous humor in uveitis, and keratoconus.

While significant damage to the turbinates should generally be avoided when possible, some patients may require frank removal of the turbinates for oncological or reconstructive purposes. Common\u00a0indications for resection of turbinates are the development of Schneiderian papillomas, specifically inverted papillomas, which often arise on the middle turbinates and require resection to prevent recurrence\u00a0or malignant degeneration into squamous cell carcinoma. In cases of other sinonasal or orofacial malignancies, partial or total maxillectomy may be necessary, and these procedures will often also involve resection of one or more turbinates. Lastly, the turbinates themselves may be used as part of a reconstructive effort. The inferior turbinates are commonly used as regional flaps, based on the blood supply at the anterior face of the turbinate arising from the anterior lateral nasal and anterior ethmoidal arteries, and they are very effective for providing mucosal\u00a0resurfacing during total or subtotal nasal reconstruction\u00a0or for repairing large septal perforations.

Lastly, dysfunction of the olfactory epithelium that leads to a loss of smell and a reduction in the sense of taste can also significantly impact patient well-being.

The 3 main types of UV rays that the sun emits are known as UVA, UVB, and UVC. Ninety-five percent of the UV radiation reaching earth is UVA rays, which are a great cause of photoaging due to their ability to penetrate deep into the skin. UVA rays are known to induce indirect DNA damage by creating free radicals via reactive oxygen species and decreasing the activity of antigen-presenting cells of the epidermis. [3] . UVA rays are used in tanning booths, can also penetrate clouds and glass. They are prevalent year-round. UVB rays, also known as sunburn rays, have a 290 to 320 nm wavelength and are more associated with skin cancer than UVA tanning rays, which have a 320 to 400 nm wavelength.

The primary form\u00a0of prevention is avoiding excessive exposure to the sun\u2019s ultraviolet radiation. Additionally, patients should discontinue the use of tanning beds. [7] Patients should be instructed to monitor the UV Index, which is an international measurement of the strength of UV rays at a specific time and location. This can be accessed through the weather channel, radio, local newspaper, or the internet. The sun's UV rays are usually the strongest between 10:00 am and 3:00 pm. A great trick recommended by the American Cancer Society is to instruct a patient to measure their shadow in the sun. If their shadow is shorter than their actual height, the sun\u2019s UV rays are at their strongest. Patients should be instructed to either avoid being outside during that time or to increase their use of protective methods against the sun. Wearing UV protective clothing when possible such as a wide-brimmed hat, full-length clothing, and UV-protective sunglasses should always be encouraged. Be mindful of using clothing made of fabric that does not permit the passage of sunlight when held up to the sun. Some clothing is now made with additional sun protection called ultraviolet protection factor (UPF). UPF provides greater protection from UV exposure from the sun. A UPF rating of 30 means that the fabric will only allow one 1/30 of UV radiation to pass through the material. Anything with a UPS rating over 25 is considered very good, and anything over 40 is considered excellent. [8]", "contents": "Skin Cancer Prevention -- Function.

Sunscreens come in various types and contain different ingredients that protect against the sun in different ways. Chemical ingredients, such as the frequently used para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) and cinnamates, absorb solar rays and change UV rays into heat energy. Ingredients like zinc oxide and titanium dioxide work as a physical barrier that deflects UV rays off of the skin. Selecting sunscreens that are labeled as broad-spectrum is important because that indicates that the patient will be protected from both UVA and UVB rays. Zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, aside from creating great barrier protection, are excellent ingredients to look for in sunscreens due to their broad-spectrum UV coverage. [9] An important topic when counseling patients about skin cancer prevention is the sun protection factor (SPF). The SPF number represents the amount of protection from sunburn that sunscreen offers compared to using no sunscreen at all. For example, if a patient\u2019s skin would normally take 10 minutes to burn and the patient appropriately applies SPF 30 sunscreen, it would take him or her 30 times longer (300 minutes) to burn. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends using a sunscreen with SPF 30, which filters out about 97% of UV rays from the sun. [10]", "contents": "Skin Cancer Prevention -- Function.

Nevertheless, this assay is subject to variability and inhibition through several chemical reactions. Variants of the LAL assay use chromogenic, turbidimetric, or viscometric methods to measure the degree of clotting. The sensitivity of this assay method depends on the sample type, processing method, time, and the dilution factor.\u00a0The LAL assay is used in urine, cerebral spinal fluid, synovial fluid, ascites fluid, vaginal and cervical fluids, bronchoalveolar lavage samples, and even seawater.

The natural carriers for LPS, such as LBP or serum carrier proteins such as HDL and LDL, as well as synthetic aptamers, peptides, and metal-cation complex, are used to bind and pull down LPS in these assay methods. Different types of signals serve to detect and enhance the readout of the LPS signal. Electrochemical (EC) sensing requires a recognition ligand and a transducer to measure the variation in signal. Fluorescence-based sensing needs a receptor that captures LPS, and another molecule emits a fluorescent signal upon binding to the antigen. Aptamers attached to gold nanoparticles have been used to detect LPS using EIS. This technique has an enhanced detection limit of 0.1 pg/mL. Aptamers are also being used in a magnetic aptasensor to detect LPS. The use of lipid complexes (liposomes) has also been useful as a testing mechanism. This method manipulated the amphipathic nature of LPS. These biosensors provide high sensitivity, up to picogram or femtomolar range.

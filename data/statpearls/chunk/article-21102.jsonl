A brief review of adnexal high-grade serous carcinoma with near-ubiquitous TP53 mutations can provide insight into another possible etiology of endometrial high-grade endometrioid carcinomas. Arising in the fallopian tube, the evolution of adnexal high-grade serous carcinoma from serous tubal in situ carcinoma associated with p53 signatures in tubal endothelium has been established by evidence through molecular, transitional, and epidemiological research. From this, the developmental similarities between adnexal high-grade serous carcinoma and endometrial serous carcinomas are evident for their mutual associations with p53 signatures in morphologically normal epithelium through the apparently in situ phases of serous tubal in situ carcinoma transitioning to high-grade serous carcinoma and, likewise, serous EIN transitioning to endometrial serous carcinomas with the potential intra-abdominal dissemination of very small, early cancerous lesions. High-grade adnexal carcinomas with aberrant p53 but nonpapillary serous, endometrioid, transitional cell morphology, and aggressive behavior are now classified as high-grade serous-transitional cell carcinomas.

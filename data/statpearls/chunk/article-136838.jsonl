One of the systems uses a fixed flow of oxygen delivered through an oxygen distribution system (ODS) that consists of tubing connected to a diffusive membrane in the shape of a wheel.\u00a0 The ODS is placed above the wound bed and underneath a moist wound therapy dressing chosen by the wound care provider.\u00a0 The other system uses an integrated oxygen distribution system within an oxygen diffusion dressing (ODD) available in multiple sizes, with or without an adhesive border. This system does not require\u00a0using other dressings yet can be used with any non-occlusive\u00a0dressing. The ODD system also has the ability to vary the oxygen flow rate, which can aid in the management of exudate and pain levels and monitor the pressure in the wound bed.\u00a0 The ODD system monitors wound bed pressure and do not allow the pressure in the wound bed to exceed 20 mm Hg, which is at the lowest reported levels of capillary collapse in skin tissue. [10] This may be of significant benefit since it ensures that the localized pressure does not limit the underlying flow of nutrients and blood to the tissue."}

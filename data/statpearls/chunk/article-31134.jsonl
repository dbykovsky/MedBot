[131]", "contents": "Vesicoureteral Reflux -- Anatomy and Physiology -- Primary Vesicoureteral Reflux. Primary VUR is the most common type and is a direct result of the UVJ's failure to function normally. This failure usually takes the anatomical form of a shortened intramural length with an abnormally direct and high lateral connection of the distal ureter to the bladder due to early ureteral budding. Consequently, a short intramural ureter impedes the UVJ's ability to prevent retrograde urinary reflux. While a short intramural ureter is a primary cause of VUR, other factors may contribute. These include ureteral duplication, ectopic ureteral orifices, bladder outlet obstruction, increased intravesical pressure, abnormal trigonal anatomy (diverticulum and ureterocele), and abnormal bladder function.

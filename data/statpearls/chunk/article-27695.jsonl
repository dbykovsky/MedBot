PSV is deliverable with invasive (through an endotracheal tube) or non-invasive (via full face or nasal mask) mechanical ventilation. This ventilatory mode is the most comfortable for patients and is a useful ventilator setting for weaning from invasive ventilation and for providing supportive care with non-invasive ventilation. [1] Flow (L/min) delivery is by setting a driving pressure (cmH2O). The flow delivered will be dependent on the set driving pressure, airway resistance, lung compliance, and inspiratory effort of the patient. The breath is flow-limited, meaning that the driving pressure terminates when the flow decreases to a set percentage (usually 25%) of the peak flow. Tidal volume (mL) delivered is dependent on the flow and the duration of the inspiratory phase. Settings for PSV mode include driving pressure, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). Minute ventilation (L/min) is dependent on the patient\u2019s respiratory rate, and the tidal volume delivered with each breath. No mandatory breaths are given in PSV; thus, no minimum minute ventilation is ensured. [2]", "contents": "Pressure Support Ventilation -- Introduction.

This circuit includes the nasopharynx, oropharynx, trachea, bronchial tree, and alveoli.

Non-invasive ventilation utilizes the placement of a mask over the nose and mouth secured via a cushion and elastic straps around the head. If the endotracheal tube cuff or mask seal is not fully occlusive, this results in an air leak and decreased flow and tidal volume.

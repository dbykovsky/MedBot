Dental anxiety affects children and adults, and its prevalence has been reported in the literature as approximately 20% in various population-based studies. As a result, patients can develop avoidance tendencies, potentially leading to poor dental health. This severe form of dental anxiety has been found to affect approximately 5% of the general population. When non-pharmacological anxiety management methods are insufficient, conscious sedation becomes extremely useful. [21]"}

The clinician must not compensate for poor insufficient local anesthesia by deepening levels of sedation due to the potential complications associated with deep sedation, including increased morbidity and mortality. When a trained operator delivers conscious sedation effectively, it is a safe alternative to general anesthesia, which helps to reduce waiting list times and eliminate the complications associated with having a general anesthetic.

It is less expensive than general anesthesia, which is very costly as it requires a hospital setting, specialist nurses and theatre staff, etc. In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, it is against the law to perform general anesthesia within a dental practice setting. Therefore, providing treatment under sedation in an outpatient setting can reduce the financial burden on healthcare organizations. Anesthesia or dentists trained in advanced techniques can provide poly-pharmaceutical sedation, allowing the treating dentist to focus on the required procedure.

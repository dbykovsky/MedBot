There are no tasks to complete, and no focus is placed\u00a0on \"fixing\" the grief. However, he does describe six \"needs of grief\" or mourning that are more experiential. He acknowledges the need for grief to be both experienced and expressed, confronting the reality of the loss in tolerable doses. The bereaved must lean into or embrace the pain of the loss while focusing on self-compassion and self-care. He includes a narrative component\u00a0as the bereaved transition their relationship with the\u00a0departed from one of presence to one of memory and the need to explore their new identity in living without their lost beloved.

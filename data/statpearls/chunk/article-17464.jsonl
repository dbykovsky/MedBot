In certain situations, pulmonary function tests may be warranted to monitor the potential development of pulmonary toxicity. [13]", "contents": "Amiodarone -- Adverse Effects. Pulmonary toxicity generally manifests within the initial year of amiodarone use and most commonly resembles interstitial lung disease. However, pulmonary toxicity can also appear in various forms, including organizing pneumonia, pleural effusion, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Unfortunately, there is no pathognomonic finding that definitively diagnoses amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity, and the diagnostic process entails a comprehensive evaluation to exclude alternative diagnoses. Mortality associated with amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity has been reported to be nearly 10%. Fortunately, the use of steroids has shown efficacy in managing this adverse reaction. Patients initiating amiodarone therapy are advised to undergo baseline and annual chest x-rays. In certain situations, pulmonary function tests may be warranted to monitor the potential development of pulmonary toxicity. [13]"}

[14] This toxicity is typically associated with thyroiditis. Consequently, clinicians must conduct baseline thyroid function tests and follow-up assessments every 6 months due to the risk of thyroid-related issues. Amiodarone-induced thyroid toxicity should be suspected in patients experiencing weight loss or any alterations in cardiac status. Treatment of hypothyroidism includes the use of levothyroxine. Conversely, addressing hyperthyroidism may involve a combination of corticosteroids, propylthiouracil, or methimazole, and in some cases, thyroidectomy. Patients with preexisting hyperthyroid disease are susceptible to developing thyrotoxicosis due to the iodine content in amiodarone. Managing amiodarone-associated thyrotoxicosis can be intricate and is associated with a heightened risk of mortality. This complexity is further compounded by amiodarone's beta-blocking effects, which can obscure the classic symptoms of thyrotoxicosis. [15]", "contents": "Amiodarone -- Adverse Effects.

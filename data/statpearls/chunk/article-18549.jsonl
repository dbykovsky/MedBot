[69] Moreover, there are no significant differences while comparing time to treatment, mortality, and favorable outcomes between intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT) and endovascular thrombectomy (EVT), probably owing to collateral flow from posterior communicating arteries towards the posterior circulation.

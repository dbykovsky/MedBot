Options for the management of uncomplicated pseudoaneurysms include observation, ultrasound-guided compression, ultrasound-guided thrombin injection, and surgical repair. Uncomplicated femoral artery aneurysms less than 2 to 3 cm in diameter may undergo spontaneous thrombosis and regression with observation alone with interval screening, or they can be managed with ultrasound-guided treatments. Those that are greater than 3 cm rarely spontaneously thrombose, though not an absolute rule. [29] For this reason, femoral artery aneurysms greater than 3 cm require intervention, even if asymptomatic. Ultrasound-guided thrombin injection is a well-established, minimally invasive method for treating accessible pseudoaneurysms and is usually recommended first over open or endovascular surgical repair. Several studies have reported a very high success rate (97% to 100%) for femoral pseudoaneurysms with a single treatment, even while patients are on anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents. [30] Risks of the procedure include embolization and pulmonary embolus, with a shorter aneurysm neck length correlating to a higher risk of embolic complication. An aneurysm neck length of <2 mm has the highest risk. Overall, however, complications are very rare. Ultrasound-guided thrombin injection is not recommended for pseudoaneurysms <1 cm due to the theoretical risk of arterial embolization, though these can safely undergo an attempt at ultrasound-guided compression. [16] For pseudoaneurysms that are being monitored and are enlarging, become acutely symptomatic, or are still greater than 1 cm at 6 weeks, intervention is recommended. Surgical management of femoral pseudoaneurysm is reserved for patients with at least 1 unsuccessful duplex-guided compression or thrombin injection and those with anastomotic disruptions. If surgical repair is required, blood should be typed and crossed and made rapidly available, as inadvertent entry into the pseudoaneurysm before achieving proximal and distal hemostatic control can result in massive bleeding. The surgical options include endovascular therapy with the use of coil embolization or stenting and open surgical repair.

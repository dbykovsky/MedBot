The flap is then incised with a scalpel and elevated in the subcutaneous plane using dissecting scissors, ensuring sufficient thickness to include the subdermal plexus. An assistant may provide counter-traction using skin hooks to aid in this process. Similarly, undermining up to 2 to 4 cm around the flap and defect enables secondary tissue movement for tension-free closure. However, undermining more than 2 to 4 cm may improve redraping but is liable to increase closure tension, somewhat counterintuitively. [30] While flap transposition is the primary tissue rearrangement component of this reconstruction method, secondary movement of surrounding skin towards the flap is also important. Essentially, rhombic flap transposition resembles an eccentric variant of the Z-plasty technique, where the Z-plasty flaps are asymmetric, and the rhombic flap serves as the smaller, more acutely angled flap.

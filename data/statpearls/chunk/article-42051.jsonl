The beneficial effect of peripheral neurolysis of supratrochlear and supraorbital nerves on migraine was discovered when Guyuron found that his patients were relieved of a debilitating migraine\u00a0after brow lift surgery. [43] Subsequently, the group published a prospective study confirming the findings. [14] Neurolysis is performed after identification of trigger sites and when pain relief is more than 50% for at least 6 weeks by injecting BT. One can instill BT in the bilateral frontal, temporal, over corrugators, and occipital region (12.5 units each). [14] [15] Examination of hypertrophied nasal turbinates irritating the nasal septum should be done."}

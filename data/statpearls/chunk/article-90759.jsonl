[11] The risk becomes even greater with higher doses and\u00a0longer infusion time. [27] Zoledronic acid affects the kidneys by altering key metabolic pathways in the renal tubular cells. Microscopically, the damage is similar to that seen in acute tubular necrosis. [11] [28] Recovery from zoledronic acid kidney damage is possible but slow. [28]"}

[1] Roughly 1.5 million women between the ages of 45 and 55 experience menopausal symptoms, often involving hot flashes, flushing, and night sweats, also known as vasomotor symptoms. Additional symptoms include irritability, mood and sleep disturbances, fatigue, decreased libido, dyspareunia, and atrophic vaginitis. The Women's Health Initiative trial has made the use of estrogen therapy obsolete to prevent vasomotor symptoms, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular diseases. Although estrogen therapy remains a controversial treatment in symptomatic menopausal women, due to the risks potentially outweighing the benefits, there is a definite need for estrogen therapy, particularly in the non-systemic form, in women experiencing distressing symptoms. Without it, a third of women experience at least itching, irritation, dryness, and dyspareunia, leading to decreased quality of life. Localized estrogen treatment often relieves these symptoms and significantly increases the quality of life, including life-changing improvements in sexuality, the incidence of urinary tract infections, and incontinence. [2] The method of estrogen delivery is vital in assessing its benefits and uses. For example, the use of estrogen transdermally, in stark contrast to orally, has been linked to a lower risk of deep vein thrombosis, cholecystitis, osteoporosis, and stroke. Estrogen therapy has also\u00a0proved beneficial in a patient with an increased risk of osteoporotic fractures with long-term use.", "contents": "Estrogen Therapy -- Indications.

Although there is currently a reduction in estrogen therapy as a preventative treatment, it is still routinely used to treat menopausal symptoms locally. Typically, drugs administered vaginally are used mainly for their local effects, but they can also have systemic effects. Estrogen is a steroid hormone that plays a central role in the reproductive system by altering the transcription of genes in specific organs and tissues, primarily the uterus and vagina. The genes undergo alteration through the act of estrogen on certain receptors, known as nuclear transcription factors. Once bound by estrogen, these nuclear transcription factors are then able to bind to promoter regions in sequences of specific genes and are therefore able to regulate these genes. [3] Once these genes get transcribed, this allows for the development, regulation, and maintenance of the uterus and vagina.", "contents": "Estrogen Therapy -- Mechanism of Action.

The pH of the vaginal lumen in the years preceding menopause typically ranges between 4.5 and 6.0, as it varies relative to the menstrual cycle. Estrogen is responsible for decreasing the pH of the vaginal lumen by acting on the vaginal-ectocervical epithelial cells to increase proton secretion.

Stryker monitoring can is an option when the clinical exam is unequivocal, or the patient is intubated and sedated. A delta pressure of less than 30 is more specific to compartment syndrome than an absolute compartment pressure of greater than 30. Delta pressure is the difference between diastolic blood pressure and compartment pressures measured by the stryker monitor. The history usually includes a swollen forearm following some form of trauma or a vascular insult. Multiple bone fractures, especially when on the ipsilateral extremity has a strong association with compartment syndrome. However, isolated fractures such as both-bone forearm fractures in adults and supracondylar humerus fractures, especially those with associated vascular injuries, in kids are frequent causes of compartment syndrome. [7] The flexor digitorum profundus and flexor pollicis longus are often injured most severely secondary to their deep location. Tense and non-compressible compartments are more specific to compartment syndrome than a softly swollen forearm. During the physical exam, it is vital to assess all three compartments, as the pathology can be limited to just one compartment. The most sensitive exam finding is a pain with passive stretch or extension of the fingers or wrist.

Compartment syndrome is primarily a clinical diagnosis. Stryker monitoring can is an option when the clinical exam is unequivocal, or the patient is intubated and sedated. A delta pressure of less than 30 is more specific to compartment syndrome than an absolute compartment pressure of greater than 30. Delta pressure is the difference between diastolic blood pressure and compartment pressures measured by the stryker monitor. The history usually includes a swollen forearm following some form of trauma or a vascular insult. Multiple bone fractures, especially when on the ipsilateral extremity has a strong association with compartment syndrome. However, isolated fractures such as both-bone forearm fractures in adults and supracondylar humerus fractures, especially those with associated vascular injuries, in kids are frequent causes of compartment syndrome. [7] The flexor digitorum profundus and flexor pollicis longus are often injured most severely secondary to their deep location. Tense and non-compressible compartments are more specific to compartment syndrome than a softly swollen forearm. During the physical exam, it is vital to assess all three compartments, as the pathology can be limited to just one compartment.

The AIN continues in the forearm to innervate muscles but lacks a sensory component. Compression of the median nerve versus the AIN can be differentiated as the median nerve contains a sensory component and therefore the patient will complain of sensory deficits.

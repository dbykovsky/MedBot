Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) agonists are peptide analogs of the GnRH molecule that act as agonists at the GnRH receptor in the pituitary gland.\u00a0 Their initial activation at the GnRH receptor causes a flare effect, temporarily increasing serum gonadotropins and downstream sex hormone concentrations. Prolonged activation of the GnRH receptor, typically following 2-4 weeks of continuous therapy, leads to involution or downregulation of the receptor, thereby suppressing pituitary function leading to hypoestrogenism. [40] GnRH agonists have a diverse array of clinical applications. Regarding symptomatic fibroid management, they are used for short-term treatment of AUB, typically inducing a state of amenorrhea, and help improve symptoms of uterine enlargement. Given their side effect profile with long-term use, GnRH agonists are meant to be utilized as a bridge therapy prior to surgical or interventional procedures or natural menopause. [2] Leuprolide acetate, the most studied and most frequently administered GnRH agonist for fibroid therapy, is given as an intramuscular depot injection, either as a monthly injection of 3.75 mg for up to three months or an 11.25 mg 3-month formulation as a single dose."}

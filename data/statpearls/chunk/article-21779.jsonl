Urologists, as with all surgeons, utilize and bring the components of the fire triangle into proximity, increasing the risk of a surgical fire. Three main components of the fire triangle are required for a surgical fire to take place: fuel source, oxidizer, and an ignition source. [1] The first component is a fuel source. Common fuel sources include degreasers, prepping agents, drapes, towels, sponges, dressings, tapes, gowns, hoods, masks, ointments, benzoin, aerosols, alcohol, mattress, pillows, blankets, ECG electrodes, hoses, tissue, GI gases. [2] The second component is an oxidizer. Common oxidizers are room air, oxygen, nitrous oxide. [2] Lastly, the third necessary component is an ignition source. Common ignition sources include a light source, laser, electrocautery, sparks from high-speed drills and burrs, defibrillators, glowing embers of charred tissue, flexible endoscopes, tourniquet cuffs.

Bilateral vestibular hypofunction is a debilitating complication associated with bilateral labyrinthitis, most commonly caused by bacterial meningitis. It can result in visual impairment (oscillopsia) and impaired spatial awareness, often leaving patients reliant on mobility aids. [57] After severe cases of labyrinthitis, some patients may be left with hearing loss or tinnitus, which can be managed with a hearing aid or tinnitus-specific therapies. [36]"}

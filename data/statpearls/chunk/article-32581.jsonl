The cuboid has five articular surfaces that contribute to the intrinsic movement of the foot. These articulations include the calcaneus posteriorly, the fourth and fifth metatarsals anteriorly, and the navicular and lateral cuneiform medially. The cuboid bone is stabilized in the middle of the lateral column by many ligaments, including the calcaneocuboid, cuboideo-navicular, cuboideo-metatarsal, and long plantar ligaments. The cuboid bone serves as one of the bony attachments for the tibialis posterior tendon. The peroneal sulcus is a groove located on the lateral aspect of the cuboid through which the peroneus longus tendon passes before inserting on the lateral base of the first metatarsal and medial cuneiform. This arrangement allows the cuboid to serve as a pulley during contraction of the peroneus longus muscle. The cuboid provides inherent stability to the foot by its role as the supporting element of the static and rigid lateral column of the foot. Though the cuboid bone is not directly involved in weight-bearing, it is subjected to stress forces during standing and ambulation, and its contribution is essential to the mobility of the lateral column of the foot.

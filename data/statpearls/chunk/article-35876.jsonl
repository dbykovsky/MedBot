[4] Many\u00a0population-based studies have found a low level of serum iron/ferritin (and other micronutrients) among patients with pica. [5] [6] [7] . Despite this, studies conducted on substances consumed by pica patients failed to show increased iron bioavailability among these substances. This suggests that the idea that these cravings stem from a need for serum iron is an inadequate pathophysiological explanation for this phenomenon. [8] Another proposed hypothesis that is gaining more attention is that pica for non-nutritive substances offers protection from harmful toxins during the most vulnerable stages of human cell replication and embryogenesis (childhood and pregnancy). [9] [10] [11] The proposed mechanism of protection is binding to toxins and decreasing their intestinal absorption. [12] [13] [14] In pagophagia, a Japanese study hypothesized that when a patient with anemia chews ice, it increases perfusion thus improving brain function. They contributed that to the activation of the dive reflex which would lead to peripheral vasoconstriction and an increase in central perfusion. Another explanation would be sympathetic activation which would also increase blood flow to the brain. [15]", "contents": "Pica -- Etiology.

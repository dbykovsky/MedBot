As the liver senses a decrease in cholesterol production, it attempts to compensate by increasing the number of LDL receptors on the surface of its cells, which leads to increased uptake of two lipoproteins, LDL and VLDL, into the liver, which then metabolizes into cholesterol and other molecules. Statins effectively decrease the number of circulating LDL molecules and VLDL in the serum, leading to the desired decrease in cholesterol deposition into tissues. [18] Other medications include ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors in addition to statins to lower LDL-C greater than 50%, especially in high-risk patients. Newer drugs that target cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism will be critical in managing or preventing ASCVD in the future."}

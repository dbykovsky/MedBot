While screening is crucial to identify domestic and family, several barriers exist. In spite of the prevalence of domestic violence, many clinicians do\u00a0take the time to screen patients. Unfortunately,\u00a0no\u00a0universal approach has been established to assess for domestic violence. In addition, many clinicians do not have the time, resources, or desire\u00a0to get involved with an abuse or neglect investigation. Many health professionals remain ignorant\u00a0of the warning signs and risk factors. In most states, reporting of suspected elder abuse or neglect is required by statute. However, few health professionals are prosecuted for failure to comply, further hindering reporting.\u00a0Routine screening increases the odds domestic abuse cases will be identified.

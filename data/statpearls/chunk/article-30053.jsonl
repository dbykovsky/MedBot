Encephalopathy and ataxia require more time for clinical improvement. [39]", "contents": "Vitamin B1 (Thiamine) -- Monitoring. The serum level of thiamine is not a reliable indicator of thiamine status. However, thiamine function can be measured by erythrocyte transketolase activity (ETKA). An EKTA of 0% to 15% is considered adequate, 15% to 25% is considered a moderate risk, and 25% or higher is considered a high risk for thiamine deficiency. [36] [37] Direct measurement of erythrocyte TPP\u00a0is performed\u00a0using whole-blood testing and has more sensitivity, specificity, precision, and robustness. [36] The concentration of TPP in the whole blood ranges from 70 to 180 nmol/L. [8] Urinary thiamine excretion can measure adequate dietary intake.

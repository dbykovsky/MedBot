The interventional cardiologist's role is the decision-making about the initiation of mechanical support devices and placement of the IABP and or other percutaneous mechanical support devices and revascularization for acute myocardial infarction. Advanced heart failure cardiologist evaluation is essential to assess for the requirement of durable ventricular assist devices or heart transplantation, and, if needed, can coordinate for listing the patient for durable VAD and heart transplantation. Additionally, heart failure specialists can provide further recommendations about treatment options for patients with decompensated heart failure complicated by cardiogenic shock. Further, the cardiothoracic surgery team should be promptly involved in patient care if mechanical complications of myocardial infarction, i.e., severe mitral regurgitation due to papillary muscle rupture or ventricle septal rupture, is diagnosed and require urgent surgical repair. Furthermore, the role of intensivist is imperative in care as patients with cardiogenic shock secondary to myocardial infarction usually experience multi-organ failure, and require intensive care interventions to prevent and treat multi-organ dysfunction and manage the critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilator support, and prevent and treat malnutrition, delirium, pressure ulcers, and thromboembolism. [58] The intensive care unit physician plays the role of a coordinating physician and serves the responsibilities of diagnosis, triage, activation of subspecialties and additional team members, and medical management of the cardiogenic shock patients with multi-organ failure. Moreover, an intensivist has a vital role in ensuring the adequate functioning of the IABP and continuous monitoring for early identification of the device-related complication and its management. Intensivist and interventional cardiologists must be cognizant of the patient's goals of care consistently throughout the care. In conditions of refractory cardiogenic shock with an inappropriate response to medical therapy, revascularization, inotropes/vasopressors and IABP support, and further escalation of care to heart transplantation or permanent ventricular assist device is not a goal or deemed futile, and an interprofessional team approach can assist in the transition of care to end of life care/comfort care. In such a condition, consultation of the palliative care/hospice care team to provide comfort care\u00a0is warranted.", "contents": "Intra-Aortic Balloon Pump -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes. Although the SHOCK II study fails to demonstrate short-term and long-term mortality benefits with IABP therapy adjunctive to PCI in ST-elevation MI complicated by CS as compared to a medical therapy group, it may be secondary to extensive damage to the heart muscle tissue not able to sustain the cardiac function for an increased period of time despite IABP support. In such patients, IABP may be an option as temporizing hemodynamic support to bridge to the durable mechanical assistance device or heart transplantation. Therefore, early consultation with an interprofessional cardiogenic shock team, including an interventional cardiologist and advanced heart failure specialist, before or at the time of IABP insertion may prove beneficial to devise a plan of care about urgent revascularization. Such a plan can ensure the adequacy of the hemodynamic support and contemplate a long-term plan of care to improve survival outcomes.

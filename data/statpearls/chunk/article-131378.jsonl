Dilaceration describes an unusually abrupt angle between tooth crown and root or within the root itself, resulting from trauma during the development of the tooth. Further anomalies of the dental hard tissues include gemination, where a single tooth forms two crowns. This is a consequence\u00a0of the tooth bud's partial division, resulting in a bifid crown but retaining the normal number of expected teeth within the dental arch. [30] However, fusion leads to one less tooth within the dental arch as it comprises two separate developing tooth germs which join together.

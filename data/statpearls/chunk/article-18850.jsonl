Identifying which patients may develop this as a complication of their underlying disease process is paramount. Early recognition of hypercapnia can help prevent further deterioration of the patient's condition into CO2 narcosis. Prodromal symptoms to recognize before CO2 narcosis develops can include increased confusion and increased work of breathing. After identification, treatment should be sought immediately. A modifiable risk factor is tobacco abuse. Encourage patients to stop abusing tobacco and provide information regarding nicotine replacement therapy and other cessation treatment."}

The etiology of CO2 narcosis can be broad, and depending on the cause, can produce different challenges for the care of the patient. Each team member plays an integral role in patient care, but involvement is largely a function of the underlying cause of hypercapnia. These patients are in the intensive care unit (ICU) and require continuous monitoring by nurses. The patient has multiple needs during their care. Chiefly, their condition needs to be addressed ideally by a pulmonologist or an intensivist. Their tools to treat the patient include various modalities such as medications and ventilator management. Nurses play an essential role in these patients by constantly monitoring them, administering medications, and informing the clinicians of any changes in the patient's condition. Nutritionists are also vital to patient care to develop a diet tailored to the patient's needs. This requirement is especially crucial for the patient on a ventilator. Additionally, pharmacists must assist with medication optimization and patient education regarding the proper use of their medications. Poor medication compliance and adherence may have contributed to the patient's condition. After the patient has returned to their baseline, some patients may benefit by speaking to case management regarding living and social environments. Many patients that develop CO2 narcosis have an acute exacerbation of an underlying chronic disease state, such as COPD. These patients may become frustrated and become distressed by their chronic disease. After the condition resolves, speaking to a psychologist may improve the patient's outlook on the future and frame of mind. This is why an interprofessional team approach is needed to address these patients to achieve improved outcomes.

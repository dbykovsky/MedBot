Acoustic neuromas account for around 80% to 90% of CPA lesions. Differential diagnoses of an acoustic neuroma include the following: Meningioma (5%-10% of CPA lesions) Ectodermal inclusion tumors Epidermoid (5%-7% of CPA lesions) Dermoid Metastases Neuroma from cranial nerves other than cranial nerve VIII: Trigeminal neuroma. Facial nerve neuroma Neurinoma of the lowest\u00a04 cranial nerves (IX, X, XI, XII) Extensions of nearby lesions in the CPA: Dolichobasilar ectasia Aneurysm Cholesterol granuloma (distinct from epidermoid) Neurenteric cyst Arachnoid cyst Brainstem or cerebellar glioma Pituitary adenoma Craniopharyngioma Chordoma and tumors of the skull base Fourth ventricle tumors (ependymoma, medulloblastoma) Choroids plexus papilloma from the fourth ventricle through foramen of Luschka Glomus jugulare tumor Tumors of the temporal bone"}

Leukocyte esterase identifies the presence of\u00a0WBCs in the urine. The WBCs release leukocyte esterase, presumably in response to bacteria in the urine. Leukocyte esterase can detect WBCs in the urine, but this can occur for other reasons, like inflammatory disorders and vaginal infections. Its reported sensitivity is 62% to 98%, with a specificity of 55% to 96%. [11] Despite this, leukocyte esterase is generally not considered as reliable a UTI indicator as nitrites. Hematuria can be a helpful finding because bacterial infections of the transitional cell lining of the bladder often cause some bleeding. This finding helps distinguish a UTI from vaginitis and urethritis, which do not cause blood in the urine."}

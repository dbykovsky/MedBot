Although available from the time the person is diagnosed with COPD, palliative care is typically recommended for GOLD stage D. It is additional care to the patient's ongoing treatment plan. The goal is to provide the best quality of life possible. Not only does it play a role in the assessment and management of the symptoms, but it also helps patients understand their illness and facilitates a discussion about the patient's goal of care, advanced care, and end-of-life care plans.

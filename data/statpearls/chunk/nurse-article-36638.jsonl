Spinal shock refers to the spinal cord impairment below the level of injury, including paralysis, loss of reflexes, anal sphincter tone, bowel and bladder control, as well as persistent penile erection (priapism) that can occur following a spinal cord trauma. Spinal cord injury can be associated with spinal fractures, dislocations, tearing of ligaments, rotational distraction, and tearing of the disc space. If the spinal shock is not associated with significant spinal column injury, the prognosis is more favorable. The treatment of patients with significant spinal shock and injury presents a challenge. Aggressive\u00a0medical management and nursing care can reduce spinal shock effects on the overall functionality of the patient.

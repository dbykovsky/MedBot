This technique involves making an elliptical incision circumscribing the breast and including the nipple areolar complex while keeping the site of the tumor as a central landmark.

There has been much controversy over the ideal flap thickness, with the ultimate goal of removing all possible breast tissue while preserving skin viability. [19] As noted above, mastectomy dissection should continue to the anatomic boundaries of the breast, regardless of the type or location of skin incision used. Flaps are elevated and retracted at a right angle to the chest wall while the surgeon retracts the breast tissue away from the overlying tissue. The skin flap is elevated to the level of the clavicle superiorly, the anterior border of the latissimus dorsi laterally, the sternal border medially, and to just below the inframammary crease inferiorly. Once the dissection of the overlying flaps is complete, the breast is removed, working from the superomedial border to the inferolateral border. A closed suction drain is usually placed beneath the skin flaps in the wound bed, and the incision is closed in a two-layer fashion using absorbable suture.", "contents": "Mastectomy -- Technique or Treatment.

{"id": "article-24763_25", "title": "Mastectomy -- Complications", "content": "Patients tolerate mastectomy well in most settings with low morbidity and mortality. However, several possible complications may occur. These include seroma or hematoma formation, wound infection, skin flap breakdown or necrosis, and lymphedema. Seroma is a collection of fluid in a surgically created cavity that results from the transection of vessels and lymphatics. Most surgeons used closed suction drains beneath the skin flaps to decrease the rate of seroma formation. The frequency of surgical site infection in patients undergoing breast surgery is approximately 8%. [15] The most common organisms involved are Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus epidermis, and infections should receive treatment with an appropriate antibiotic, with or without opening of the wound. Similarly, flap necrosis occurs in about 8% of patients and is related to inadequate blood supply to the flap, wound closure under tension, obesity, and type of incision (vertical versus transverse). Necrosis is managed with debridement and skin graft coverage if indicated. Lymphedema is less commonly present since the advent of modified mastectomy techniques. Axillary lymph node dissection is the most significant risk factor for the development of lymphedema, with a reported incidence of greater than 20%. Comparatively, 3.5 to 11% of patients who have sentinel lymph node biopsy develop lymphedema. [20] In patients who develop lymphedema, early intervention with physical therapy and decompressive massage techniques can help prevent progression and, in some cases, reduce lymphedema.", "contents": "Mastectomy -- Complications.

Malignant hyperthermia is a reaction to the volatile halogenated anesthetics or depolarizing muscle relaxants, causing sustained muscle contraction, hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, and hypercarbia,\u00a0potentially leading to intraoperative patient demise. These symptoms develop as a response to the anesthetic agents acting on defective ryanodine receptors (calcium channels in muscle cell sarcoplasmic reticulum). Given the mechanism of action, dantrolene acts as an antagonist to these receptors, therefore halting and preventing the further progression of the symptoms of malignant hyperthermia. Even though the incidence of susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia is estimated to be 1\u00a0in 50,000\u00a0to 100,000,\u00a0it is required, according to the Malignant Hyperthermia Association of the United States, that any facility that administers malignant hyperthermia triggering agents (isoflurane, desflurane, sevoflurane, and succinylcholine) should stock dantrolene in their facilities at all times. [1] Hospitals should keep a stock of dantrolene on hand if they administer malignant hyperthermia-triggering agents. [2] Other FDA-approved uses for dantrolene\u00a0include muscle spasticity disorders, as seen with upper motor neuron disorders, including stroke, spinal cord injury, cerebral palsy, and multiple sclerosis. It is the only FDA-approved oral peripherally-acting antispasmodic medication for these disorders.Dantrolene is also used for the treatment of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (given its similarity in presentation and symptoms to malignant hyperthermia) as well as for the\u00a0overdose of 2,4-dinitrophenol\u00a0(a banned \"fat burner\" medication that interrupts\u00a0ATP synthesis and causes hyperthermia). However, these are considered off-label uses.Recently, researchers studied dantrolene in the treatment of vasospasm following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Single-dose administration of intravenous dantrolene decreases arterial vasospasm, although this remains an off-label use. [3] Interestingly, research on Alzheimer disease has shown that increased intracellular calcium release modulates amyloid genetic processing in the brain, thereby\u00a0promoting memory loss. Researchers have identified ryanodine\u00a0receptors as a possible culprit of this phenomenon.

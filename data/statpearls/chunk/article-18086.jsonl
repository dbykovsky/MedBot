In the majority of the cases, infections are self-limited with no complications and do not require any treatment other than supportive care. However, B. cereus infections can become severe in immunocompromised patients and those with a direct infection of ocular tissue after penetrating trauma. These cases can rapidly progress to permanent vision loss, septicemia, and even death. Prompt recognition and a high degree of suspicion are required to improve outcomes. The clinical pharmacists can assist the medical team by assuring the appropriate selection of antibiotics as B. cereus is naturally resistant to two major classes of antibiotics. The critical care nurse can help minimize these infections in immunocompromised individuals by promptly removing indwelling central venous catheters. For mild cases, the nurse plays a vital role in educating patients on the appropriate food storage to prevent outbreaks. Care coordination between nurses, pharmacists, and medical providers will decrease the incidence of this disease and improve outcomes for critically ill patients.[Level 5]"}

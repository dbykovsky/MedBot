[1] the use of catheter ablation was first introduced in the late 1960s; it was designed first for recording, where the surgical treatment of cardiac arrhythmia was the main concept. In 1967, the concept of induction of cardiac arrhythmia was first introduced through programmed electrical stimulation. [2] in the late 1970s, Wellen was able to perform programmed electrical stimulation. and record the activation sequences from more than one recording catheter, followed by the development of both the surgical ablation and the intracardiac recordings. [3] Previously the arrhythmia was terminated by surgical maneuvers, for example, surgical excision of the triggered arrhythmogenic focus for atrial tachycardia and cryo excision of the AV junction in case of resistant supraventricular tachycardia. [4] The maze procedure is one of the well-known procedures, particularly during mitral valve surgery complicated with atrial fibrillation (AF), for AF termination. [5] In 1981, the concept of the transvenous catheter was first defined when a patient that was undergoing an electrophysiological recording following defibrillation, where a\u00a0high-voltage discharge was emitted when the defibrillator electrode hit the catheter electrode at His.

Unipolar signals provide precise activation and give directional information. Unfiltered shows significant far-field activity is recorded that can make it difficult to see small local unipolar signals without increasing the size of the signal so much it swamps the amplifier. Respiratory drift is another problem.

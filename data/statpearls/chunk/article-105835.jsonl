Therefore barriers to effective patient care must be identified and addressed. [4] The level of mobilization necessary is dependent on the patient's level of deficit. Periodic changes in position such as rolling the patient, sitting in bed, hanging legs off the side of the bed, and periodic standing are all appropriate goals based on patients' functional status. A stepwise progression of mobility can minimize complications such as excess pain and wound exacerbation or dehiscence. Therefore assisting patients with mobility while keeping in mind all barriers to treatment and potential complications are essential to decrease hospital stay and optimize patient care and well being.", "contents": "Assisting Patients With Mobility -- Definition/Introduction.

In addition to verifying appropriate dosing and performing medication reconciliation, pharmacists should emphasize the importance of medication compliance to patients and the need for close follow-up. If there is evidence of non-compliance, pharmacists should discuss the situation with clinicians managing the case. Pharmacists and nurses should assist in educating patients about the adverse effects of the drugs so that they know when to report back to clinicians; they must also be alert to signs of therapeutic failure, which must be documented and reported to other team members as necessary so that regimen modification can be implemented if required. Only through such an interprofessional team approach with open communication channels between all team members can the morbidity of anticonvulsants be reduced and safe outcomes be achieved.", "contents": "Antiepileptic Drug Monitoring -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

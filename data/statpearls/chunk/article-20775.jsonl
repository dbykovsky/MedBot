Ms. Tarasoff kissed Mr. Poddar on New Year\u2019s Eve of 1968. Mr. Poddar took a liking to Ms. Tarasoff; however, she did not reciprocate. Mr. Poddar began struggling mentally regarding the circumstances and began seeing a counselor at Cowell Memorial Hospital at the recommendation of a friend in 1969. [2] [5] [6] During a counseling session in August of 1969, Mr. Poddar disclosed to his psychologist, Dr. Lawrence Moore, that he was going to kill Ms. Tarasoff. Dr. Moore notified the campus police and requested that they bring Mr. Poddar to a nearby hospital to initiate an involuntary examination. The campus police interviewed Mr. Poddar but released him shortly after. When the Director of Psychiatry, Dr. Harvey Powelson, learned of the events, he demanded the destruction of all clinical notes as well as the letter which was sent to the campus police by Dr. Moore regarding Mr. Poddar. Ms. Tarasoff returned to the U.S. from her trip in October and on October 27th of 1969, Mr. Poddar arrived at the home of Ms. Tarasoff, shot her with a pellet gun and stabbed her numerous times. Authorities subsequently charged him with 2nd-degree murder; however, five years following these events, Mr. Poddar was released provided that he return to India, his home country, immediately. The parents of Ms. Tarasoff filed a lawsuit against the University of California, resulting in the Tarasoff I decision which required mental health providers to warn potential victims.

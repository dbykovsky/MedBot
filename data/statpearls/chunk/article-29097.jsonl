Local flaps, by definition, consist of tissue that lies adjacent to the defect; to reach their destinations, they may be advanced, rotated, transposed, interpolated, or any combination thereof. [5] [19] [20] [21] Classic examples include O-to-H flaps, O-to-Z flaps, rhombic and bilobed flaps, and\u00a0melolabial flaps (see Image . Rhombic Flap for Mohs Defect of the Right Cheek). Unlike regional and free flaps, local flaps tend to have random pattern blood supplies, meaning there is no vascular pedicle\u00a0but rather that the subdermal plexus supplies oxygenated blood and provides venous drainage.

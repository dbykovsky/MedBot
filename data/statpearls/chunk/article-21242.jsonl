Although sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, by definition, is a fatal condition, the prognosis of patients with epilepsy, in general, can range from poor to excellent. The prognosis regarding developing SUDEP in a patient with epilepsy can be assessed using a variety of tools, including the SUDEP-7 inventory. This determines a patient's risk based on multiple factors, including: Three\u00a0or more tonic-clonic seizures in the past year One\u00a0or more tonic-clonic seizures in the past year One or more seizures of any type in the past year More than 50 seizures per month in the past year Duration of epilepsy greater than or equal to 30 years Treatment with three or greater anticonvulsants Intellectual disability with a measured IQ of less than 70 [25]"}

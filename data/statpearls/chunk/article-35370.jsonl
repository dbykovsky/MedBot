Under each of these main categories are additional subcategories which further describe the finding. [1] For example, the description of masses is by their shape, margin, and density. A mass may be oval, round or irregular in shape. It may have circumscribed, obscured, microlobulated, indistinct or spiculated margins. The density of a mass may be high, equal, low or fat containing. The various descriptors correlate with varying levels of suspicion for malignancy. Microlobulated and indistinct margins are suspicious findings. Spiculated margins are highly suspicious for malignancy. [4] Similarly, low-density masses have low suspicion for malignancy whereas high-density masses should generate a high suspicion for malignancy.

It is also one injury that keeps an athlete out of action for a long time and requires proper rehabilitation before returning to play. Multiple recurrences could complicate the process of rehabilitation. In athletes who are in sports involving running and sprinting as well as non-athletes like dancers, hamstring\u00a0injury should be considered if they experience acute, sharp posterior thigh pain that restricts further participation in sports unless it is clinically or radiologically ruled out with certainty.

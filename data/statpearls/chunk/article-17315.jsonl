The applications of this technology are varied, including verifying the placement of endotracheal tubes, assessing disease severity and treatment response, and monitoring sleep apnea in outpatient settings. With the progress of technology, smaller sensors have been utilized in different scenarios, such as pre-hospital surroundings and high-performance military planes. These offer possibilities for new applications that can be integrated into breathing masks. [23]"}

For instance, laparoscopic surgery involving creating a pneumoperitoneum can lead to reduced lung compliance and increased ventilatory pressures due to the diaphragm's cephalad displacement. While prone positioning can benefit the respiratory system, it requires careful airway management to prevent disconnection of the endotracheal tube. One-lung ventilation during thoracic surgery affects ventilation-perfusion matching and requires lung-protective strategies. Jet ventilation is a specialized technique requiring a shared airway or a still chest. It can be performed at low frequencies for laryngeal procedures or at high frequencies for specialized interventions, with considerations for airway pressures and gas exchange. Knowing these ventilation strategies and their implications in various surgical scenarios can enhance patient care and outcomes. [25]", "contents": "Airway Monitoring -- Technique or Treatment.

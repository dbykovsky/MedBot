Medication-related errors have long been cited as a cause of patient harm - this includes incorrect medication administration, incorrect dosing, and administration of medications to which patients have documented allergy. [19] [20] While responsibility certainly falls on individuals to verify correct medication, correct dose, and patient allergies before ordering and administering medication, this topic was also covered in \"To Err is Human\" and an area for systems-level improvement. The advent and wide-spread implementation of Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) have been imperative to developing protections against medication errors. EMRs could verify the correct dosage based on a patient's weight, verify the dosing frequency, and provide an alert if a medication ordered conflicts with the patient's allergy list. [21] These are systems protection at the time of the physician ordering medication; EMRs also provide levels of protection for nursing colleagues. Many hospitals have implemented a barcode scanning system in which a patient identification wristband has a barcode that must be scanned to verify the identity and accuracy of the medication prior to administration by the nurse.

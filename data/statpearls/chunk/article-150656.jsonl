As per the AAP guidelines, if the\u00a0UA\u00a0results indicate the possibility of a UTI, which includes positive findings of LE or nitrite tests or microscopic analysis revealing leukocytes or bacteria, it is advisable to obtain a urine specimen through catheterization or suprapubic aspiration for culture. However, in cases where the\u00a0UA of freshly collected urine (within 1 hour since void) shows negative results for\u00a0LE and nitrite tests, it may be reasonable to monitor the patient's clinical condition without initiating antimicrobial therapy. It is important to acknowledge that negative\u00a0UA results do not entirely rule out the presence of a UTI. The incidence of coexisting bacterial meningitis is infrequent in neonates with UTIs. Neonates with UTI who appear well, along with a procalcitonin value <0.35 ng/mL, are at a low risk for bacterial meningitis. In such cases, avoiding routine lumbar punctures in these neonates may be worth considering. [20]"}

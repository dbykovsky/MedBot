The terms hemoglobin and hematocrit are more commonly used than RBC count in day-to-day clinical practice. There are different lower limits of normal range based on ethnicity, gender,\u00a0\u00a0and age. Anemia causes decreased oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood leading to tissue hypoxia. Grading of Anemia, according to the National Cancer Institute, is\u00a0as follows: Mild: Hemoglobin 10.0 g/dL to lower limit of normal Moderate: Hemoglobin 8.0 to 10.0 g/dL Severe: Hemoglobin 6.5 to 7.9 g/dL [1] Life-threatening: Hemoglobin less than 6.5 g/dL Anemia classified into acute anemia and chronic anemia.

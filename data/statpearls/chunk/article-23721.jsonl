{"id": "article-23721_41", "title": "Intrauterine Device -- Clinical Significance", "content": "As noted above, there are two types of IUDs available in the United States, which include copper-containing and levonorgestrel-containing devices. These two types of devices have different methods of action to prevent pregnancy. The copper IUD works by preventing sperm motility and viability within the uterine cavity by causing a localized cytotoxic inflammatory response. [33] Because of this mechanism, copper IUDs are also an extremely effective form of emergency contraception if placed within 5 days of unprotected intercourse. [33] The levonorgestrel-containing IUDs work by the progesterone acting on the endometrium to suppress growth. The endometrium becomes insensitive to estradiol produced by the ovary. [7] Additionally, the levonorgestrel thickens the consistency of the cervical mucus, which prevents pregnancy by inhibiting the motility of the sperm. [7] Because of the efficacy, reliability, and reversible nature of these devices, these are often an excellent choice for women to prevent pregnancy. The higher dose\u00a0levonorgestrel-containing IUDs are also useful in the treatment of menorrhagia and endometrium protection during hormone replacement therapy. An additional benefit of IUDs lies in the fact that they may be placed immediately post-partum, within 10 minutes of delivery of the placenta.

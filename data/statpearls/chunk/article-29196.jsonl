This acute shift in ionized calcium can result in tetany. The accompanying alkalosis is treatable with ammonium chloride. Hypocalcemia may be addressed with calcium gluconate. An addition of 0.9% NS infusion and potassium supplementation may also be indicated. [19] [20]", "contents": "Sodium Bicarbonate -- Toxicity.

Clinicians need to ensure that sodium bicarbonate is the appropriate therapeutic choice. Nursing staff will either administer the drug for inpatients or give instructions for home administration for outpatient use and counsel regarding potential adverse events. Pharmacists will verify appropriate dosing, perform medication reconciliation checking for drug-drug interactions, and reinforce patient counseling points where applicable.", "contents": "Sodium Bicarbonate -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

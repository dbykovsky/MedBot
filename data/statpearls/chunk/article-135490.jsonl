One potential treatment is the use of autologous serum eye drops (ASE), prepared by centrifuging the patient's serum and diluting it in concentrations of 20%, 50%, and even 100%. Its role in PED healing is attributed to several serum constituents that contribute to multiple steps in the healing process, such as vitamin A, E, EGF, PDGF, TGF-\u03b2, nerve growth factor, and insulin-like growth factor.

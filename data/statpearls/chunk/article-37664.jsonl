More recently, this aggressive treatment has become less acceptable, leading to the investigation of less radical surgical options to preserve length and obtain surgical clearance. Cochran et al. published a literature review in 2014, looking specifically at the management options of subungual melanoma. This\u00a0review concluded that in situ excision surgery for lower-grade melanomas and melanoma is a reasonable option. This translates as excision down to periosteum or paratenon. Other deeper, higher-grade melanomas could undergo amputation at a more distal level (interphalangeal joint) than advised by Das Gupta. However, despite the encouraging evidence that surgeons are considering less aggressive options, the data quality is weak, with no randomized controlled trials and mostly retrospective data collection. The surgical excision method remains controversial and should be assessed on a case-by-case basis."}

Omicron (B.1.1.529 lineage) The\u00a0Omicron variant\u00a0was first identified in South Africa\u00a0on 23 November 2021 after an uptick in the number of cases of COVID-19. [26] Omicron was quickly recognized as a VOC due to more than 30 changes to the spike protein of the virus and the sharp rise in the number of cases observed in South Africa. [27] The reported mutations include T91 in the envelope, P13L, E31del, R32del, S33del, R203K, G204R in the nucleocapsid protein, D3G, Q19E, A63T in the matrix, N211del/L212I, Y145del, Y144del, Y143del, G142D, T95I, V70del, H69del, A67V in the\u00a0N-terminal domain of the spike, Y505H, N501Y, Q498R, G496S, Q493R, E484A, T478K, S477N, G446S, N440K, K417N, S375F, S373P, S371L, G339D in the\u00a0receptor-binding domain of the spike, D796Y in the\u00a0fusion peptide of the spike, L981F, N969K, Q954H in the\u00a0heptad repeat 1 of the spike as well as multiple other mutations in the non-structural proteins and spike protein. [28] Many subvariants of Omicron, such as BA.1, BA.2, BA.3, BA.4, and BA.5,\u00a0have been\u00a0identified. [3]"}

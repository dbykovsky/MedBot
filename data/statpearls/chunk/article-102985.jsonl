Understanding the intricacies of MET involves understanding the biomechanics of the human body; this knowledge can help make treatments with other modalities easier. For example, those with an in-depth understanding of human biomechanics can treat lesions of high velocity using less force and more precision.

In today's MET, there are a total of 9 different physiological principles: crossed, extensor reflex, isolytic lengthening, isokinetic strengthening, joint mobilization using muscle force, respiratory assistance, oculocephalogyric reflex, reciprocal inhibition, muscle force in one region of the body to achieve movement in another and post-isometric relaxation.

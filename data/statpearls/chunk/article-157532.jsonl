In addition to rigid perfectionism, the patient must exhibit 2 of the following 3 traits: Perseveration, characterized as persistence at tasks long after the behavior has ceased to be functional or practical. Intimacy avoidance, characterized by avoiding close or romantic relationships, interpersonal attachments, and intimate sexual relationships.

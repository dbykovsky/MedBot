Plummer\u00a0disease's natural history is well-researched and documented.

It can start as low TSH and subclinical hyperthyroidism and may eventually lead to thyrotoxicosis if not treated. It is usually seen after the age of 50. The condition is best treated with surgery or radioactive iodine. Regular follow-ups to assess post-operative hypothyroidism or disease recurrence are required for the rest of the patient's life. Lifelong antithyroid therapy is necessary if a patient is a poor candidate for surgery or refuses surgery or radioactive iodine.

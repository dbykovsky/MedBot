They first appear at the end of the fourth week and develop through into the fifth week. Although there are five arches, they are numbered one to four as the fifth arch is underdeveloped. [1] The pharyngeal arch is coated on the outside by a layer of ectoderm and a layer of endoderm on the inside; mesoderm is situated in-between. [2] Each arch is associated with cartilage, a cranial nerve, and an aortic arch, which we will describe later in more detail. The mesenchyme from each arch also develops into different skeletal and muscle components.

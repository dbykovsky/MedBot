Loss of total circulating blood volume due to both and/or fluids loss causes hypovolemic shock. If the lost volume doesn't get replenished in a timely fashion, this will lead to a lack of oxygen delivery and transport to vital cells and organs in the body, which might lead to the failure of these organs and, ultimately, death."}

In patients with non-hemorrhagic hypovolemic shock, the etiology of fluid loss must be promptly identified and treated. Monitoring electrolytes and acid/base status in patients in hypovolemic shock are of utmost importance. Determining a patient's response to fluid resuscitation should rely on various assessments, including ultrasound, pulse pressure wave variation, passive leg raises, or central venous pressure, in addition to relying on clinical presentation and laboratory values such as lactate. For replacement fluids, we recommend isotonic crystalloids over colloids.", "contents": "Hypovolemic Shock -- Pearls and Other Issues.

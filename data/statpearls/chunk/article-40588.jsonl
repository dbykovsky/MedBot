Diagnostic modalities typically used to evaluate tracheal trauma include cervical or chest radiography, cervical or chest computed tomography (CT), or bronchoscopy. Chest x-ray is often the initial imaging study used to rapidly assess for\u00a0pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema,\u00a0endotracheal or tracheostomy tube cuff overinflation, and tracheal deviation, findings that can suggest tracheal injury. [15] (see Image. Chest X-ray With Bilateral Pneumothoraces). If a tracheal injury is suspected in a stable patient, a CT of the neck and chest with IV\u00a0contrast is the preferred modality to visualize\u00a0pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, or pneumoperitoneum and concomitant injuries. [17] [5] A patient with a potentially unstable unsecured airway should not be placed in a CT scanner, as a supine position will increase the risk of airway collapse.\u00a0Up to 70% of patients with acute tracheobronchial injury will have a pneumothorax; 60% will have pneumomediastinum and cervical emphysema. While chest CT is superior to radiographs in diagnosis, it may still yield false negatives due to adjacent edema, hemorrhage, or\u00a0secretions. CT has the added advantage of diagnosing injuries to adjacent structures, including sternal fractures and mediastinal hematomas, as well as vascular disruptions when IV contrast is used. Concomitant injuries to the great vessels, cricoid cartilage, laryngeal nerve, and esophagus which is involved in 25% of penetrating upper airway injuries, as well as cervical spine injuries that occur in 10% to 50% of patients with blunt airway injury, may be diagnosed by CT. secretions. A CT angiogram may also be performed to evaluate patients with possible vascular injury, particularly the carotid artery, the most commonly injured vessel with tracheobronchial trauma. [17] [5]"}

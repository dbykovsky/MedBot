In cases where severe or tortuous stenosis hinders accurate endoscopic measurement, CT images provide a valuable alternative for estimating stenosis length. [43] Based on the severity, length, and location within the trachea or larynx, the choice of stent type and the decision between open and endoscopic surgical approaches are determined. At this stage, a multidisciplinary team, including pulmonologists and cardiothoracic surgeons, can offer valuable insights and contribute to the surgical plan. [44]"}

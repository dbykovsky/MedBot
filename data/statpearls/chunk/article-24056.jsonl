Parents should also be educated regarding the importance of compliance with thickened and positional feedings.", "contents": "Laryngomalacia -- Deterrence and Patient Education. Education on the symptoms of laryngomalacia is of the utmost importance for parents, particularly the inconsistent correlation between noisy breathing and failure to thrive. Children can be quite noisy breathers but still grow and develop quite normally, and noisy breathing frequently remains even postsurgically. [23] Caregivers should be aware that treatment is mainly conservative, but that close follow-up is mandatory to monitor for worsening symptoms. Adherence to medication regimens should be encouraged. Parents should also be educated regarding the importance of compliance with thickened and positional feedings."}

Diagnosis of laryngomalacia is optimal with awake fiberoptic flexible laryngoscopy. Severe symptoms of laryngomalacia, including recurrent cyanosis or respiratory distress, apnea, and failure to thrive, require further workup with direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy to rule out other synchronous airway abnormalities. Surgery is generally only an indication in patients with severe laryngomalacia with significant breathing difficulties or failure to thrive. Supraglottoplasty is the surgical method of choice and is generally well-tolerated. Patients with neurologic comorbidities, cardiac comorbidities, and those\u00a0younger than 2 months of age are more likely to require revision surgery for relief of upper airway obstruction.", "contents": "Laryngomalacia -- Pearls and Other Issues.

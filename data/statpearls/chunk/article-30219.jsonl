{"id": "article-30219_28", "title": "Fibula Tissue Transfer -- Clinical Significance", "content": "Because of the fibula's ability to provide up to 30 cm of straight, healthy bone with minimal morbidity at the donor site and minimal postoperative functional limitation, it has become a commonly-used source of grafting material. Applications for fibula grafting run the gamut from oncological resections to chronic infections to post-traumatic defects and congenital anomalies. Direct medialization of the fibula has even been described for reconstructing long tibial defects. [24] Vascularized fibular grafts are particularly useful because they improve the perfusion of the recipient site, which then improves healing, particularly in\u00a0patients with\u00a0chronic infection or a history of radiation therapy. Fibular grafting, while technically complicated, has the added advantage of being more rapid and less morbid than the classical Ilizarov technique for addressing leg length discrepancy. [6] [24] The indications for fibular grafting are broad, and the surgical techniques vary, and specialists from orthopedics, plastic surgery, otorhinolaryngology, and oral-maxillofacial surgery all rely upon the fibula to solve reconstructive problems in their patients.", "contents": "Fibula Tissue Transfer -- Clinical Significance.

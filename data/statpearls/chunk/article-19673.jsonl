[21] It was previously believed that all vestibular schwannomas arise from this transition zone, which for the vestibulocochlear nerve lies between\u00a09.28mm\u00a0- 13.84 mm along\u00a0its length\u00a0after exiting\u00a0the brainstem, in the medial third of the interior auditory canal (IAC). [22] However, detailed anatomical study has revealed that schwannomas may occur at this point, as well as more laterally within the IAC and from the labyrinthine portion of the nerve. [23]"}

The usual presentation is progressive, unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, and commonly associated symptoms are tinnitus and vertigo. Notably, facial nerve (CN VII) palsy rarely occurs with vestibular schwannomas because the facial nerve is resistant to chronic pressure. MRI is the diagnostic imaging of choice.

Etiology can either be peripheral, most commonly vestibular neuritis, or central, such as brainstem or cerebellar stroke. Vestibular neuritis is usually viral in origin and self-limiting, while a central stroke can have permanent effects. Therefore, it is critical to distinguish between these two etiologies to ensure proper patient care. This can be done at the bedside using the \u201cHead-Impulse\u2014Nystagmus\u2014Test-of-Skew\u201d (HINTS) exam. The horizontal head-impulse test, which assesses the vestibulo-ocular reflex, would be normal with central etiologies and abnormal with peripheral etiologies. Nystagmus would be vertical and/or bidirectional with central etiologies and unidirectional with peripheral etiologies, regardless of gaze direction. Skew deviation would be present with central etiologies and absent with peripheral etiologies. [24]", "contents": "Neuroanatomy, Cranial Nerve 8 (Vestibulocochlear) -- Clinical Significance.

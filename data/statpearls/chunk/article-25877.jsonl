The initial step in the development of allergic contact dermatitis, as in nickel allergy, is hapten binding to a skin carrier protein. A hapten by itself is not immunogenic but becomes so after binding to a skin protein carrier. The hapten protein complex forms through covalent bonds between the hapten and amino acid side chains of target proteins within the skin. [8] The complex ultimately produces the sensitization of T cells. Sensitized T cells encountering the antigen at any time later will then lead to the release of cytokines, which in turn leads to macrophage activation and produces the immune response. [8] In summary, the sensitization process requires an initial exposure to allow the immune system to recognize the antigen later and lead to the immune response that causes ACD.", "contents": "Nickel Allergy -- Pathophysiology.

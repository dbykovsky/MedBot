It is not considered the first line for depression due to the several adverse effects of this drug. This drug has off-label use in the treatment of bulimia nervosa, irritable bowel syndrome, neuropathic pain, overactive bladder, postherpetic neuralgia, and ADHD. Efficacy of desipramine can be established within the first two weeks of treatment of bulimia nervosa patients. The data showing this came from a study of 77 patients plotted on a receiver operating character curve examining the relationship between time and symptom reduction. Alleviation of symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome and neuropathic pain is accomplished by the antinociceptive properties of desipramine. Desipramine has demonstrated therapeutic antinociceptive benefits, most likely via its influence of norepinephrine. In addition to patients with simple overactive bladder, desipramine was found to be useful in patients with complex overactive bladder caused by pelvic radiation and overactive bladder with pain. Desipramine is one of the established first-line drugs in treating postherpetic neuralgia; however, clinicians are often inclined to use second-line medications such as gabapentin due to its toxic profile. Desipramine has shown mild effectiveness in the treatment of ADHD. [1] [2] [3]", "contents": "Desipramine -- Indications.

{"id": "article-20405_3", "title": "Desipramine -- Mechanism of Action", "content": "Currently, the most widely accepted theory of desipramine\u2019s mechanism of action is that it blocks the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin in the presynaptic neuronal membrane. Researchers have proposed secondary amine tricycle antidepressants such as desipramine to have greater norepinephrine blockade compared to tertiary amine tricyclic antidepressants, which have greater blockade at serotonin receptors. Reuptake blockade increases the available neurotransmitter level in the synapse. Antinociceptive effects of desipramine appear to occur via manipulation of norepinephrine. In addition to these mechanisms, desipramine appears to downregulate beta-adrenergic receptors and serotonin receptors.

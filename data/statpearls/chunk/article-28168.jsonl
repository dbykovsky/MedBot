Radial nerve damage at this level can cause wrist drop, a condition notable for the inability to extend the wrist.\u00a0A lateral supracondylar fracture may also damage the radial nerve but will present differently from a midhumeral injury. Nerve branches to the brachioradialis and extensor carpi radialis longus arise above this fracture so that these muscles are largely unaffected. Instead of presenting with a wrist drop, the patient's wrist weakly extends radially when asked to extend the hand. [16] [20] [21]"}

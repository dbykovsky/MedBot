Other factors that can predispose one to develop Chilaiditi syndrome include congenital malpositions, functional disorders such as chronic constipation caused by colonic elongation and redundancy, gaseous distension of the colon, small liver due to cirrhosis or hepatectomy, ascites due to increased intraabdominal pressure, substantial weight loss in obese patients and abnormally high diaphragm or diaphragmatic paralysis (which can present in conditions such as diaphragmatic muscular degeneration or phrenic nerve injury), a chronic obstructive lung disease that causes enlargement of the lower thoracic cavity, and multiple pregnancies. Intellectual disability and schizophrenia are also associated with anatomic variations that result in the Chilaiditi sign.

The following criteria must be med to diagnose Chilaiditi sign based on radiological findings: the right hemidiaphragm must be elevated above the liver by the intestine, the bowel must be distended by air to illustrate pseudo-pneumoperitoneum, and the superior margin of the liver must be depressed below the level of the left hemidiaphragm.

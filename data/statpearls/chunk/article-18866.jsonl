Extensive resections may be necessary in cases of atypical carcinoids or significant destruction of the distal lung parenchyma. The surgical technique of choice is often lobectomy. In some cases, sleeve resection or wedge resection may also be performed. Since\u00a0carcinoids often arise from the main or lobar bronchi, bronchoplastic\u00a0procedures are usually required during surgical resection to preserve lung function and maintain proper airway continuity. A wedge resection\u00a0is favored in\u00a0peripheral carcinoids\u00a0and is often sufficient. [2]"}

Melanomas can be found anywhere on the body, are usually irregularly pigmented but can be amelanotic. Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis is a type of cancer where Langerhans cells accumulate in the body and result in the formation of granulomas, often in the bones, resulting in bone pain. These granulomas can also appear in the skin like rashes, erythematous papules or blisters (see Image. Histology, Trichodysplasia spinulosa). An interesting association with this condition is the effect of the pituitary gland, which can be affected and individuals may present with diabetes insipidus, infertility, or other endocrine diseases due to insufficient hormones. Other serious and deadly complications are due to pancytopenia (anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia) as a direct response to overcrowding by the Langerhans cells. Merkel cell carcinoma is an uncommon cancer of the Merkel cells and is categorized as neuroendocrine small cell carcinoma", "contents": "Anatomy, Skin (Integument), Epidermis -- Clinical Significance. Squamous cell carcinoma is cancer that arises from mutated keratinocytes, usually due to UV damage in individuals with Type I or II skin types (light skin, blue or green eyes, red or blonde hair, burn and never tan) and often appear as scaly, flaky, thick red patches that may bleed or even appear wart-like. This type of skin cancer can metastasize. Squamous cell carcinoma may arise from actinic keratosis, which is also caused by sun damage to the epidermal layer of skin and may have cutaneous horns. Basal cell carcinoma is a cancer of the basal layers of the epidermis and is much less likely to metastasize. This type of skin cancer is more common in sun-exposed areas and often appear are pearly papules on the face, with telangiectasias and ulcerate easily. Melanomas are cancers of the melanocytes and have a high metastatic potential, significantly mediated by the depth of the lesion.

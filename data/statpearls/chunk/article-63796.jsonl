A meta-analysis of 72 studies with 4795 teams across a range of industries revealed that successful information sharing predicted team performance. [32] Information sharing is most crucial during periods of handoff, including interdepartmental transfers from the emergency room to the operating room or intensive care unit, during a change of shift, and across professional boundaries, including physician to nurse.

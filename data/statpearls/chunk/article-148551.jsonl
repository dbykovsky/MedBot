COPD is characterized by airflow limitation and is often associated with smoking, while OSA involves recurrent airway obstruction during sleep. Risk factors for overlap syndrome include older age, male gender, smoking, obesity, and chronic bronchitis. Patients with overlap syndrome may experience worsened symptoms, increased hypoxemia, and higher rates of morbidity and mortality compared to those with COPD or OSA alone. Diagnosis typically involves polysomnography for OSA and pulmonary function tests for COPD. Treatment strategies may include lifestyle modifications, positive airway pressure therapy, pulmonary rehabilitation, and pharmacotherapy. Effective management of overlap syndrome requires a multidisciplinary approach involving pulmonologists, sleep specialists, and other healthcare professionals.", "contents": "COPD and Sleep Apnea Overlap -- Pearls and Other Issues.

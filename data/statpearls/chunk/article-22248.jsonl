Recently, an oral formulation of the somatostatin approved showed equivalent efficacy to the injectable forms. [17] [18] Side effects of SRL include abdominal pain, nausea, flatulence, diarrhea, and hyperglycemia. The primary role of SRL is as an adjunct to radiation after surgery; however, in certain instances, it may be used to decrease the tumor size or improve cardiovascular function preoperatively. [19] [20] A second-generation somatostatin analog includes Pasireotide. [21] [22] [23]"}

Since the gastrointestinal system has exposure to a significant number of pathogens, it is vital for immune surveillance. Once a pathogen is encountered by the M cells in the epithelium, they are presented to the dendritic cells and the macrophages across the membrane via the porous basal lamina, primarily via the transcellular M cell-specific pores.

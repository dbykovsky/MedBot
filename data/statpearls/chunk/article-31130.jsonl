Assessing for nystagmus is a key portion of the physical exam when a patient presents with vertiginous symptoms. [1] A functional vestibular system allows one to maintain gaze during rotation through vestibular ocular reflexes. With a unilateral dysfunction in the vestibular system, the eyes drift slowly away from a target and then correct with a fast movement in the reverse direction resulting in the appearance of a \u201cbeat\u201d in the direction of the fast phase. In a peripheral vestibular lesion, the fast phase is away from the affected side, and the frequency and amplitude of nystagmus will increase with a gaze toward the side of the fast phase. For instance, a rightward gaze will increase right-beating nystagmus. In peripheral lesions, the predominant direction of nystagmus remains the same regardless of the direction of gaze, while central lesions may present with nystagmus that reverses direction. [19] Central lesions can present with nystagmus in any direction, while peripheral lesions often present with horizontal nystagmus with a torsional component. It is important to note that nystagmus resulting from a peripheral lesion is never purely torsional or vertical. A physical examination technique to help further determine etiology\u00a0is the head impulse or thrust technique. In this exam, the patient is asked to keep their eyes fixed on a distant target with prescription eyeglasses if needed. The head is then turned quickly to the right or left by about\u00a015 degrees. A normal response occurs when the eyes remain on the target. An abnormal response is when the eyes are dragged off of the target in the direction of the head turn, followed by a saccade back to the target. This response implies a peripheral lesion resulting in a deficient vestibulo-ocular reflex on the side of the head turn. Finally, a provider may test for skew, which involves the examiner covering one eye and observing for a vertical shift in the eye when uncovered. Central lesions sometimes produce a slight skew deviation. When the head impulse test is combined with an examination of nystagmus and a test for skew, this is referred to as the HINTS (Head Impulse-Nystagmus-Test for Skew) test. [20] A normal head impulse test on both sides with direction-changing nystagmus or skew deviation is concerning for a central lesion.

The primary treatment for BPPV is focused on head rotation maneuvers that displace calcium deposits back to the vestibule through canalith repositioning or the Epley maneuver. [33] The benefit of the Epley maneuver is that the patient at home can perform it. To perform a modified Epley maneuver (as shown in the image), instruct the patient to position themselves upright on a bed with their head turned 45 degrees to the left and a pillow behind them. The\u00a0pillow should be positioned so that when supine, the pillow is directly under their shoulders. Once the patient is in position, they should like back quickly onto the pillow, so the head is reclined onto the bed. They should hold this position for 30 seconds. Without raising their head, they should then turn their head 90 degrees to the opposite side (right) and hold this position for another 30 seconds. After 30 seconds, they should turn their body and head another 90 degrees to the right and wait for another 30 seconds. Finally, they should sit up on the right side of the bed. This maneuver can be repeated starting on the opposite side and should be performed at least three times a day until the patient has no further episodes of positional vertigo for 24 hours. The Epley maneuver is effective in 50 to 90% of patients. [34] Unfortunately, BPPV is intractable in a select number of patients, and surgical treatment can be an option, particularly if symptoms are disabling. Surgical options include occlusion of the posterior canal with bony plugs or transection of the posterior ampullary nerve.

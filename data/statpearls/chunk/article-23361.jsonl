Patients can struggle with the psychological impact of living with a stoma and should be appropriately counseled beforehand.", "contents": "Ileal Conduit -- Complications. Delayed complications include those involving the newly formed stoma, such as parastomal hernia, retraction or stenosis, and bleeding. Frequent urinary tract infection (UTI) can often be a problem for patients, and up to 6% end up dying from end-stage renal failure. These patients are also predisposed to developing renal stones, and ultrasound (USS) imaging can detect this. Metabolic complications can be of significant consequence; hence regular follow-up is needed to ensure electrolytes are normal, and the patient is not acidotic. Patients can struggle with the psychological impact of living with a stoma and should be appropriately counseled beforehand."}

This is because the terminal ileum is the predominant site of absorption of micronutrients such as B12 and magnesium. [6] This is not usually seen for a few years post-operatively as the body has a large reserve of vitamin B12. This increases a patient's risk of macrocytic or megaloblastic anemia and subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Levels should be checked at follow up appointments every 6-12 months. [13] To reduce the risk of this complication, it is taught to avoid using large terminal ileum segments. This is especially important in patients with an ileal disease such as Crohn's disease.

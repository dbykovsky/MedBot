The definitive test for diagnosing CKD-MBD is a bone biopsy followed by double tetracycline labeling, which accurately identifies the patient's histological pattern of bone disease. [41] Another emerging marker, FGF23, has gained attention recently. Despite its well-established clinical effects, FGF23 is seldom used as a biomarker due to challenges such as instability (ex vivo degradation), diurnal variability, high cost, and lack of precision.

A comparative study demonstrated that an anterolateral approach for open reduction of pediatric lateral humeral condylar fractures had better radiographic and clinical outcomes than a posterolateral approach and was thus suggested as the optimal technique. [33] ORIF is indicated for Weiss type 3 and Song stage 5 fractures. Lag screw osteosynthesis is recommended when performing an ORIF due to its lower rates of malreduction and subsequent complications. [34]"}

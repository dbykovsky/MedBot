Hemoglobin is composed of four subunits: two alpha subunits and two beta subunits, each of which contains a heme group and globin chain. The heme group contains an iron atom as ferrous form(Fe 2+) at its core that binds one oxygen molecule, allowing one hemoglobin tetramer to bind four oxygen molecules. [2] Hemoglobin exists in two states: the T (deoxygenated-tense) state and the R (oxygenated-relaxed) state. The two states differ in their affinity to bind oxygen. In an unbound state, hemoglobin exists in the T state, and binding of oxygen occurs with low affinity. The T-state hemoglobin thus requires a higher partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) to facilitate the binding of an oxygen molecule. The binding of single oxygen induces a conformational change that destabilizes the T state and facilitates the transition of the other subunits to the high-affinity R state. The binding of the first oxygen allows the second, third, and fourth oxygen molecules to subsequently bind with increasing ease. This relationship is an example of positive cooperativity.

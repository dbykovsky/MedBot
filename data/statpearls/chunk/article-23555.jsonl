{"id": "article-23555_1", "title": "Insensible Fluid Loss -- Definition/Introduction", "content": "The body uses water for a variety of mechanisms from transporting nutrients to excreting wastes and tissue structure viability. Water balance occurs by matching the daily water input/output to and from the body. The primary means of water intake is by consumption of food and fluids. Daily fluid maintenance requirements for adults are approximately 1.5 to 2.5L of water. [1] The majority of fluid loss occurs in urine, stool, and sweat but is not limited to those avenues. Insensible fluid loss is the amount of body fluid lost daily that is not easily measured, from the respiratory system, skin, and water in the excreted stool. The exact amount is unmeasurable but is estimated to be between 40 to 800mL/day in the average adult without comorbidities. [2] A total loss of approximately 600 to 800mL/day characterizes 30 to 50% of all water loss, contingent on the level of water consumed. Thus insensible water loss is a significant component of water balance and needs to be routinely monitored.", "contents": "Insensible Fluid Loss -- Definition/Introduction.

Additionally, parenteral fluid replenishment focuses on equipping the body with enough fluid to meet both insensible and sensible physiologic losses. Maintenance fluid rate replacement is calculated by using the \u201c4-2-1\u201d rule, which came from the 1950s work published in Pediatrics.

Preoperative fasting causes a fluid deficit leading to a slight decrease in the extracellular fluid while maintaining intravascular volume. Without any fluid intake overnight, a patient\u2019s fluid deficit is proportionate to the duration of the fast. This deficit is estimated by multiplying the normal maintenance rate by the length of the fast.

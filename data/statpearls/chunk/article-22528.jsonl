These positions often require arms in abduction less than 90-degree rested on the armrest or tugged in the neutral position. Whereas in the lateral position, the bottom limb is padded at bony prominence and placed in front of the patient, and the top limb is placed on top with padding in between the arms or flexed at shoulder and elbow. Prone position arms are abducted, but abduction should not exceed more than 90 degrees. An axillary roll is often utilized during prone positioning to prevent compression of the brachial plexus and axillary vascular structures.

Extreme elbow flexion in a prone position or direct nerve compression may be common modes of injury. Common complaints include numbness to the little finger and wrist. Claw hand deformity is also seen with ulnar nerve injury (flexion at the distal phalangeal and interphalangeal joints and hyperextension at the metacarpophalangeal joints). [4] Brachial plexus injury is most commonly seen in the lateral decubitus position with nerve getting compressed/tractioned near the humeral head. [7] Clinically, nerve injury can involve the upper trunk (C5-C6), causing Walter's tip deformity (arm being medially rotated, adducted, and pronated). Involvement of the lower trunk (C8-T1) will result in claw hand deformity and numbness and weakness in the ulnar nerve distribution. Median nerve injury can result in carpal tunnel syndrome along with weakness/paresthesia around the wrist and radial three and a half fingers.

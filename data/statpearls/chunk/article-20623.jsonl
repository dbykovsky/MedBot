The physiological response of the body to compensate for this loss of HCO3+ ions is by decreasing the levels of CO2, in other words, by causing respiratory alkalosis; this takes place by hyperventilation, which leads to increased expiration of CO2, leading to higher partial pressures of O2 in the arterial blood. As high altitude is a low O2 environment, the action of acetazolamide decreases the incidence of tissue hypoxia in high altitudes. Thus it is the drug of choice in altitude sickness. Loop Diuretics"}

There are four different types of dRTA, usually diagnosed by ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) loading test, but due to disturbing GI symptoms after administration, the test is sometimes abandoned. NH4Cl combines with HCO3+ ions to form urea in the liver, thus decreasing the HCO3+ levels in the blood stressing the kidneys to reabsorb more HCO3+ ions in exchange for H+ ions, thus acidifying the urine.

Immediately following the surgical correction of primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism, a period of profound, severe, and prolonged hypocalcemia may ensue, which is called hungry bone syndrome.\u00a0While there is no definitive consensus, most sources will define hungry bone syndrome as persistent low serum calcium of lower than 8.4 mg/dL for longer than 4 days after definitive parathyroid surgery. [169] [170] The sudden drop in PTH levels immediately after surgery results in unopposed accelerated osteoblastic activity as serum calcium quickly becomes incorporated into new bone, causing significant hypocalcemia.

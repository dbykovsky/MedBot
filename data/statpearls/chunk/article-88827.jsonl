[2] Regarding malaria treatment, methylene blue has been shown to improve the chloroquine response to malaria by decreasing its resistance and inhibiting Plasmodium falciparum glutathione reductase, an enzyme that prevents the formation\u00a0of byproducts formed by the Plasmodium species that triggers the body's immune response.

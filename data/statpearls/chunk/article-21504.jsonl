Human rhodopsin is a G-protein-coupled receptor made up of 348 amino acids arranged in seven transmembrane\u00a0domains, and its gene is located on chromosome\u00a03. Rhodopsin consists of a protein called scotopsin and its covalently-bound cofactor, retinal. The chromophore retinal lies in a pocket formed by the transmembrane domains of scotopsin. Retinal is a vitamin A derivative produced from dietary beta-carotene. Inactive, retinal exists in the 11- cis -retinal\u00a0conformation. Upon exposure to light, retinal is isomerized to all- trans -retinal leading to a series of changes in conformation to the form metarhodopsin II (Meta II).

The transducin alpha subunit, bound to guanosine triphosphate (GTP), then activates cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) phosphodiesterase.\u00a0 cGMP is hydrolyzed by cGMP phosphodiesterase which inhibits its activation of cGMP-dependent cation channels and causes hyperpolarization of the rod cell and consequent release of glutamate which depolarizes some neurons and hyperpolarizes others.

Once the prescriber has decided to give the patient the drug, nursing can counsel on the patient's dosing, administration, and potential teratogenicity for female patients. The pharmacist will verify dosing and perform medication reconciliation, alerting the prescriber of any issues. Nurses can also chart the therapeutic progress of the condition, monitor the patient, and report to the prescriber regarding their findings and possible recommendations so the prescriber can adjust therapy as needed. Through this interprofessional team paradigm, acitretin can deliver maximal benefit with minimal downside, resulting in better patient outcomes.", "contents": "Acitretin -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

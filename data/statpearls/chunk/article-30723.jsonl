The EGFR and RET RTKs are unique in that TKD activation do not require trans-phosphorylation. In the case of EGFR, allosteric interactions in the \"receiver\" N-lobe of the TKD of one RTK monomer maintain it in an inactive conformation. Upon dimerization, these interactions are disrupted by the \"activator\" C-lobe\u00a0of the TKD of the other RTK monomer, allowing the receiver\u00a0TKD to become active. The mechanism of TKD activation in RET RTKs is not as well elucidated. The unphosphorylated and phosphorylated TKDs both exist in an active configuration and have a\u00a0similarly low level of enzymatic activity. Speculations are that RET may exist as a trans-inhibited dimer and\u00a0that the inhibitory interactions are relieved by ligand binding. [16]"}

Intravenous immunoglobulin and allogenic lymphocyte immunotherapy increased the successful pregnancy rate among RSA patients of unknown etiology getting in-vitro fertilization. [22] In addition, they can promote successful embryo implantation by increasing the percentage of Treg cells and suppressing NK cells' activity. Cyclosporine A has been used in RSA patients because of its role in increasing Treg cells. Progesterone has been proven to decrease the risk of abortions in patients with RSA. In addition, progesterone is helpful in multiple ways, such as improving the perfusion at the maternal-fetal interface and regulating the immune response. Tregs-enhancing drugs, adoptive Treg cell target therapy, and low dose interleukin are under trial for helping RSA patients. Biologic agents such as eculizumab are used as a trial medicine to manage immune dysfunction related to preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome. [23]"}

{"id": "article-36717_1", "title": "Hepatojugular Reflux -- Etiology", "content": "Studies have correlated a positive hepatojugular reflux to multiple cardiac conditions. Some showed that hepatojugular reflux correlated best with left-sided heart failure, [3] while others demonstrate a stronger association with right-sided pressures. [4] A consistently significant relationship has been noted between a positive hepatojugular reflux and right atrial pressure (RAP), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP), and pulmonary artery diastolic pressure (PADP), suggesting it could be a marker of both elevated left-sided and right-sided filling pressures. [5] Hence, hepatojugular reflux should not be considered diagnostic of any particular\u00a0condition, but an indication that the right ventricle cannot accommodate an increased venous return. Constrictive pericarditis, right ventricular failure (commonly due to infarction), and restrictive cardiomyopathy are conditions that frequently produce a positive hepatojugular reflux. Left ventricular failure also produces this sign, but usually when the PCWP is more than 15 mmHg. Cardiac tamponade does not lead to a positive hepatojugular reflux.", "contents": "Hepatojugular Reflux -- Etiology.

Classically, the patient is placed in a semi-recumbent position with an elevation of the head of the bed to 30 to 45 degrees. There should be at least a 3 cm margin from the upper margin of the baseline JVP to the angle of the mandible. A steady abdominal pressure of around 20 to 35 mmHg is then applied. Historically, the pressure was applied for 15 seconds. [11] However, recent evidence suggests JVP elevation for 10 seconds may be adequate. [12] The site of abdominal compression does not significantly alter the test. It is not mandatory to apply pressure directly onto the liver, as intra-abdominal pressure is increased even by midline pressure. The latter, in fact, may be preferable because direct pressure to the liver may be painful. Sustained elevation of JVP by more than 3 cm is considered a positive hepatojugular reflux. An elevation of 1 to 3 cm is considered normal. Clinicians who believe placing patients in this position is cumbersome and often produces inaccuracies recommend placing the patient upright at 90 degrees, which makes the clavicle approximately 10 cm above the right atrium.

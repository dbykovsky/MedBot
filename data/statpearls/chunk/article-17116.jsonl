The risk of colon cancer in acromegaly remains a very controversial topic.\u00a0A large meta-analysis evaluating the presence of colorectal malignancy in acromegaly was published in 2008. It included around 700 patients with acromegaly compared to around 1500 controls. They found that the odds ratios of developing colon adenomas and colon cancer in patients with acromegaly were 2.5 and 4.3, respectively. [59] There remains no true consensus among different guidelines concerning colonoscopy surveillance. Some guidelines recommend screening at the time of diagnosis, and others starting at age 40.

The inner retina includes ganglion cells and amacrine cells, whereas the outer retina includes the rod and cone photoreceptors.

The photoreceptors transmit visual information to second-order neurons known as bipolar cells in the middle retina.

However, cones dominate the area of the retina responsible for visual acuity, also known as the macula, and are found in the highest concentrations in the central macula or fovea. The total number of cones outside of the macula is greater than the number in the macula due to the amount of surface area of the retina outside of this area. These photoreceptors also vary in spectral characteristics, including signal threshold, peak wavelength sensitivity, and rate of recovery.

The ffERG provides a general measure of retinal function and is useful in detecting widespread retinal dysfunction. However, the ffERG is typically normal for focal retinal diseases, including age-related macular degeneration and Stargardt's disease. Therefore, the ffERG may not reveal small retinal lesions, and further testing with alternative, focal ERG modalities may be warranted.

Therefore, determining the etiology of retinal disease by layer and by region is a frequent diagnostic challenge, and an interprofessional team approach is critical for providing appropriate patient care. Patients with sudden onset vision loss are typically encountered in the emergency department. Nurses are likely the first point of contact, who then triage the patient according to symptom acuity and severity. Given the ambiguity in clinical diagnosis and concern for emergent neurologic conditions, physicians and nursing staff routinely order a costly workup involving a battery of tests, the majority of which return negative. In turn, patients are instructed to follow up with an outpatient ophthalmologist. In most cases, these are comprehensive ophthalmologists, who then perform a standard eye examination, including ocular imaging. Notably, however, these diagnostic tests detect structural changes associated with ocular pathology, which do not always correlate with clinical findings. Consequently, patients may be misdiagnosed as having a benign condition and, in some cases, presumed to be malingering. Neuro-ophthalmology is the field that is commonly acknowledged when the etiology of vision impairment remains unknown, despite extensive medical workup. [14] [Level 4] Considering a broad differential is important to distinguish retinal dysfunction from alternative, similar appearing causes since the choice of therapy depends on the underlying etiology of the disease process. Electrophysiology, in combination with other clinical findings, offers invaluable data to assist the members of the interprofessional team and provides effective patient care while minimizing unnecessary tests. Clear communication and care coordination between nurses, physicians, ophthalmologists, as well as ophthalmology subspecialists are critical for establishing a correct diagnosis and proceeding with proper management thereafter.

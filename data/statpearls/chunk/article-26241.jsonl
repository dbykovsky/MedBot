Coordination between an interprofessional team of optometrists, primary care, emergency medicine, ophthalmologists, and nurses can improve outcomes. [Level 5]Because patients with malignant PTC or ICP elevation tend to present acutely and urgently, it is essential for ophthalmologists, primary care providers, and emergency care providers to be familiar with the signs and symptoms of ICP elevation and the potential for vision loss in this setting. Appropriate consultation with an ophthalmologist will demonstrate the requisite optic disc edema, vision loss, and peripheral field constriction associated with malignant PTC and prompt the appropriate workup to evaluate for an underlying cause of ICP elevation and the patient\u2019s suitability for ONSF. Experienced orbital surgeons and neuro-ophthalmologists should perform the surgery in a controlled setting with experienced nursing support in which they are comfortable and familiar. It is sometimes necessary to get neurosurgery involved for consideration of a CSF diversion procedure in the cases where ONSF fails to prevent further vision loss or in severe cases, such as tumors, where shunting is indicated.

Prolonged optic nerve compression by significantly elevated ICP can cause irreversible ischemic injury to the optic nerve. While ONSF has been shown to improve visual outcomes in patients with papilledema, results tend to be better the earlier intervention takes place.

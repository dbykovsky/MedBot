Awareness among health care providers, including paramedics regarding advanced trauma life support, could reduce the mortality in tracheal injuries. Most of the iatrogenic tracheobronchial injuries could be mitigated in severity with adequate precautions and backup. The use of high-volume low-pressure cuff could reduce the local tracheal trauma in intubated patients. Adequate training protocols, use of optimal endotracheal tube size, appropriate use of stylets and boogies, avoidance of overinflation of cuff could reduce the tracheal injury during intubation."}

Adequate training of the surgical team to take appropriate precautions need to be underlined. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy is a must before every resection for esophageal malignancy to rule out the evidence for airway infiltration. Cautery should be used with caution in peritracheal areas while performing head and neck operations.", "contents": "Tracheobronchial Tear -- Deterrence and Patient Education.

A high suspicion is a must to detect tracheobronchial tear/injury in all trauma patients, especially with chest and neck injuries. The vast majority of tracheobronchial injuries are managed surgically though there is a recent trend to manage patients with iatrogenic posterior tracheal wall injuries either conservatively or semi conservatively with fiberoptic endoscopic interventions. The fiberoptic endoscopic interventional management also applies to candidates who are unfit for surgical repair initially or permanently.

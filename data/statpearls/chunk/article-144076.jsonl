IOL Implantation. If the patient is operated on under topical anesthesia, they are asked to fix at the microscope light, and the IOL is perfectly centered based on the first Purkinje image. The viscoelastic is removed completely from the anterior chamber and behind the IOL in the bag, and the wound is hydrated before the final rotation of the IOL is made to align with the axis. Intraoperative aberrometry is advantageous in estimating the residual astigmatism of the eye and adjusting the IOL position intraoperatively."}

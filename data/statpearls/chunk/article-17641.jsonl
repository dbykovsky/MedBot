{"id": "article-17641_1", "title": "Neuroanatomy, Anterior Choroidal Arteries -- Introduction", "content": "As the ICA traverses superiorly, it gives off important branches such as\u00a0the posterior communicating artery (Pcom), anterior choroidal artery (AchA), anterior cerebral artery (ACA), and middle cerebral artery (MCA). Due to the presence of bilateral internal carotid arteries, these branches occur bilaterally and are a significant component of anastomosis of arteries in the base of the brain known as the circle of Willis. The circle of Willis permits collateral circulation throughout the cerebral cortex and thus allows compensation of flow when pathology such as embolus or aneurysm occurs. Even though the major branches of the ICA, such as the ACA and MCA supply entire hemispheres of the cerebral cortex, minor branches such as the AchA still play a crucial role in our daily function. Although isolated involvement of the AchA is rare, it may suffer compromise by various pathologies such as brain infarctions, aneurysms, arterio-venous malformations, and brain tumors.", "contents": "Neuroanatomy, Anterior Choroidal Arteries -- Introduction.

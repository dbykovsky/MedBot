Keratoconus is a progressive eye condition characterized by the progressive thinning and forward protrusion of the cornea, which can result in vision impairment. [3] Prognosis varies among patients, with factors such as younger age and steeper keratometry measurements at diagnosis associated with a higher likelihood of progression. Progression is also associated with corneal scarring and a decline in visual acuity.

{"id": "article-590_39", "title": "Intraoperative Echocardiography -- Clinical Significance", "content": "The clinical benefits of intraoperative TEE are of two types, those that impact hemodynamic/airway management and those that result in changes in the surgical procedure. Multiple groups have reported that intraoperative TEE for both cardiac and non-cardiac surgery detects unrecognized conditions such as hypovolemia, wall motion abnormalities and right ventricular failure. In these cases, use of TEE helps guide appropriate administration of volume, vasopressors, inotropes and inodilators. TEE has also resulted in changes in surgical procedures. It is often used to assess quality of valve repair or replacement and, if judged to be inadequate, the patient will be placed back on cardiopulmonary bypass for revision or conversion from perhaps valve repair to valve replacement. TEE has also demonstrated deterioration of wall motion post-cardiopulmonary bypass, indicating air that needs to be vented from a bypass graft, or a more serious problem that requires further surgical revision of a graft. Mild desaturation may be explained by detection of a patent foramen ovale, which can be managed by appropriate adjustment of systemic vascular resistance. A previously unrecognized large patent foramen ovale, atrial or ventricular septal defect, or clot in the left atrial appendage, have all resulted in modification of the surgical plan. Finally, severe hemodynamic instability has sometimes been explained by visualization of thrombi in the right side of the heart or pulmonary artery. In other cases, thrombi have not been visualized, but signs of right-sided heart failure, consistent with pulmonary embolism, have led to further studies that confirmed the presence of pulmonary emboli.

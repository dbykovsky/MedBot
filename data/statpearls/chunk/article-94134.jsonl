The Murray score for acute lung injury can\u00a0help assess lung injury severity. [36] This system\u00a0has four variables: hypoxemia\u00a0(PaO2/FiO2), atelectasis, lung compliance, and PEEP. Each\u00a0variable is assigned a score from 0\u00a0to 4. The sum of the scores is divided by the number of examined variables. The final score is interpreted as follows: 0 - no lung injury 0.1 to 2.5 - mild to moderate lung injury Greater than 2.5 - lung injury with ARDS The Murray Score helps clinicians determine the appropriate ventilator settings for managing\u00a0patients with acute lung injury or ARDS."}

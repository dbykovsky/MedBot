{"id": "article-43328_3", "title": "Tetracaine -- Mechanism of Action", "content": "Tetracaine functions primarily via blockade of intracellular sodium channels. The drug travels in non-ionized form across the lipid bilayer membrane and dissociates into its ionized form (cation/conjugate acid), which then acts on the alpha-subunit of the Na-channel. The drug functions as an allosteric inhibitor on the Na-channel when it is in the open-activated state; thus, the drug binds and activates faster when a Na/K channel for a particular nerve is in use. This blockade must occur at three successive nodes of Ranvier along an axon for nerve conduction to be impaired. Sodium influx is prevented during this process, thereby\u00a0stopping cellular depolarization and any potential action potential developing. [2] [3]", "contents": "Tetracaine -- Mechanism of Action.

Children with a blood lead concentration higher than 45mcg/dL, adults with a blood lead concentration of over 70 to 100 mcg/dL, or any patient with lead encephalopathy (which is usually accompanied by a markedly elevated blood lead concentration) should undergo chelation therapy under the direction of a medical toxicologist. [4] [23] A variety of chelating agents alone or in combination can be used depending on the severity of clinical presentation and the patient\u2019s blood lead concentration, including succimer, calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and British anti-Lewisite (BAL, also known as dimercaprol). It is critical to understand that chelators are slow and inefficient in their ability to reduce the total body burden of lead and in some situations can potentially be harmful because they can mobilize lead from the relatively stable bone compartment to the relatively labile soft tissue compartment, where more acute toxicity occurs. [24] As such, aggressive supportive care for severely symptomatic patients is paramount even during the administration of chelation therapy."}
{"id": "article-30343_19", "title": "Lead Toxicity -- Differential Diagnosis", "content": "As discussed in previous sections, the vast majority of individuals with elevated blood lead concentrations will have no clinical manifestations of plumbism. Those with mild symptoms often get misdiagnosed because their symptoms are so nonspecific. As such, lead toxicity should merit consideration in the differential of children presenting with behavioral problems (the so-called \u201cdifficult child\u201d) as well as those presenting with nonspecific GI complaints such as constipation, abdominal pain, or picky eating. Realistically, these types of complaints are so common in toddlerhood that relatively few are likely secondary to lead, but blood testing for lead is so simple that it should not be overlooked, particularly because these symptoms can be the harbinger of much more severe toxicity if the child continues to be exposed to lead. Similarly, many children with anemia secondary to lead toxicity are also at risk for iron deficiency anemia, and lead\u2019s role in precipitating anemia may easily be overlooked. Adults with peripheral neuropathy may present with symptoms mimicking carpal tunnel syndrome, and the underlying etiology in those with saturnine gout may not be appreciated, especially if the patient is an older male with a high purine diet (the prototypical patient who develops gout unrelated to lead toxicity). Patients with severe plumbism and especially those with lead encephalopathy may clinically look like patients with infectious or autoimmune encephalitis; again, though these cases are rare, blood lead testing is so ubiquitously available that it should not be overlooked.", "contents": "Lead Toxicity -- Differential Diagnosis.

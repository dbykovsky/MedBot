Emphasizing the risks of subtherapeutic levels can help patients understand the connection between inadequate dosing and heightened probabilities of thromboembolism and ischemic complications. Before initiating the treatment, the prescriber should establish the patient's baseline liver and kidney function and CrCl levels. This initial assessment is crucial, as dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with a CrCl of 15 to 50 mL/min.

Moreover, healthcare providers administering spinal or epidural puncture procedures should exercise caution when dealing with patients on anticoagulants, given the substantial risk of spinal and epidural hematoma, which can lead to permanent impairment. Patients must be thoroughly educated about not using edoxaban concurrently with other hematological agents, as such combinations might heighten the patient's susceptibility to pathological bleeding. Effective interprofessional communication and a shared decision-making approach between healthcare providers and patients are pivotal in cultivating trust and fostering a therapeutic alliance with patients.

Its discrete positioning may explain its poor identification during standard dissection techniques. The cranial nerve zero fibers travel centrally to subcortical structures; it sends projections to the medial pre-commissural septum and the medial septal nucleus, among others. It appears to have a rich bundle of well-vascularized fibers ascending from the nasal submucosa and projecting to important limbic structures (e.g., amygdala, hypothalamic nuclei)."}

[2] A recent meta-analysis included 14 different randomized trials looking at Pecs II block versus paravertebral blocks and found no differences in opioid utilization or pain scores between the groups in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery. Also, Pecs II blocks were found to be non-inferior to paravertebral blocks when looking at 24-hour morphine utilization and pain intensity following surgery.

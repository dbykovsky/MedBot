Unless there is an acute compression of the spinal nerves, most sciatica cases are best managed conservatively. Patients should be encouraged by the clinician and nurse to lose weight, cease smoking, and enroll in a physical therapy program. Bed rest should be limited. For some etiologies, manipulation/manual therapy may be an option. The pharmacist should caution the patient against using prescription-strength medications to avoid dependence and other adverse effects. If opioids are used, the pharmacist should assist the team by ensuring the course is concise and not refilled. Surgery should only be undertaken when conservative methods have failed, but the patient must be educated on the risks of surgery and the potential complications. Finally, even after surgery, participation in regular exercise is essential. [25] [26]", "contents": "Sciatica -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes. The key to managing sciatica is patient education. There are many causes of sciatica, and the disorder is managed best with an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals that includes clinicians, mid-level practitioners, orthopedic surgeons, osteopaths and chiropractors, physical therapists, neurologists, rehabilitation nurses, and a pain specialist.

Every surgical study measures different parameters as good outcomes, so the data are misinterpreted or exaggerated. In general, patients with chronic pain (more than 6 months) have a poorer outcome following surgery than patients with acute pain (less than 6 months). Results from some studies reported a cure rate of more than 75%, but others reported cure rates of less than 50%. There are several newer orthopedic procedures to manage sciatica, and all report success rates of 70% and above in the short term. Irrespective of the short-term result, the majority of patients with sciatica tend to have residual or recurrent pain in the long term.

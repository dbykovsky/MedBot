The anterior portion of the grey matter connects to the brain through the pyramidal tract, which originates in the cerebral cortex. [8] Signal pass along the axons found in the white matter. As the signals meet at the spinal cord, the signals translate into a movement - the motor neurons located in the anterior grey column, thus allowing for voluntary motion. Besides having the responsibility of movement, the spinal cord also plays a crucial role in receiving sensory signals. The posterior grey column is the section of the spinal cord that receives sensory signals allowing for constant interaction between the environment and the body. Instead of being situated in the middle of the spinal cord, the posterior grey column is close to the surface of the spine, allowing for easy signaling from all nerves. The dorsal horns of the grey matter are positioned to receive signals from all areas of the body. The signals originate in nerves found in the skin, bones, or joints and travel through interneurons for immediate responses and through the dorsal column-medial lemniscus tract for more involved movement. [9] This second signal method is slightly slower as the electrical signal needs to move from the sensory nerves to the brain and then back to the anterior grey column to create movement.", "contents": "Neuroanatomy, Gray Matter -- Nerves.

One of the most prevalent medical problems occurs when plaque begins to build up in areas of grey matter within the brain. These areas, known as senile plaques, take up space that was once grey matter, leading to a decrease of higher functioning. As amyloid beta continues to buildup in the grey matter, cognitive function further decreases, which causes the patient to lose memory, a condition known as Alzheimer\u00a0disease. [10] Furthermore, besides a loss in cognitive function, grey matter diseases can lead to issues with motor function as well. As the neurons in the substantia nigra begin to decrease the amount of dopamine that is released, the individual will lose control of fine motor skills. This decrease in motor function control contributes to the shaking found in patients with Parkinson disease. There are many more issues that may present themselves as the balance of grey matter is changed, and neural connections become disrupted.", "contents": "Neuroanatomy, Gray Matter -- Clinical Significance.

In the sagittal plane: anterior misplacement yields a tight knee in flexion and loose in extension, and vice versa with posterior misplacement. Clearing the resident ridge would allow a clear view and avoid anterior-posterior misplacement. On the tibial side: too anterior misplacement yields a tight knee in flexion and roof impingement in extension. A posterior misplacement will result in an ACL graft impingement on the PCL. [50]"}

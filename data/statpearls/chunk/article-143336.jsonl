This requires careful consideration of various treatment modalities, including surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, with the goal of achieving optimal outcomes while minimizing treatment-related morbidity. Surgical interventions like orbital exenteration can have a toll on a patient's mental health, and therefore, a detailed discussion with the patient and family members is needed with a focus on explaining the need for the procedure, associated risks, and consequences of not having the procedure. For those undergoing chemoradiation therapy, either as a primary modality or as adjuvant therapy after surgery, prognosis and risk of recurrence should be part of the discussion.", "contents": "Malignant Orbital Tumors -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

The sender's message delivery mode is as significant as the content of the message itself. Misinterpretation of message tone is common, hence necessitating a feedback mechanism. Verbal communication, whether written or spoken, carries an implicit tone that can significantly affect the receiver's understanding of the message. This dynamic can give rise to conflicts in various contexts, including workplaces and patient-care settings. For instance, responses must be concise and precise in an operating room. The tone accompanying the information delivery also plays a critical role; underlying emotions or attitudes conveyed in the sender's words could lead to misunderstandings and communication breakdowns. The written form of verbal communication may, at times, foster negative emotions due to an assumed tone, contrasting face-to-face exchanges that tend to be more direct. Misinterpretation of tone from written words is frequent, especially in surgical environments.

The communicator and the recipient exhibit body language, indicating positive engagement or discomfort. A person's physical demeanor often reveals their genuine sentiments, even when these may contrast with their spoken words. Examples of body language include abrupt departures after information exchange, eye-rolling, sighing, shaking one's head, avoiding eye contact, placing hands on hips, or maintaining a rigid posture. These gestures may suggest a range of emotions, from indifference and disagreement to outright displeasure. Touch, another element of nonverbal communication, can serve as an expression of empathy or an attempt to exert dominance. While these gestures typically convey benevolent intent, their reception may vary based on individual comfort levels. It is paramount to respect personal boundaries for all team members and patients. Silence, often overlooked, can deliver a potent message. It may suggest thoughtful contemplation or profound shock, rendering an individual speechless.

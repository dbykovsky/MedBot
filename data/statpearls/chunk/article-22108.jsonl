The gastrointestinal (GI) system involves three germinal layers: mesoderm, endoderm, ectoderm. Mesoderm gives rise to the connective tissue, including the wall of the gut tube and the smooth muscle. Endoderm is the source of the epithelial lining of the gastrointestinal tract, liver, gallbladder, pancreas. Ectoderm further separates into the surface ectoderm, neural tube, and neural crest. The surface ectoderm is the precursor to the epidermis, lens of eyes, nails, hair. The neural tube differentiates into the brain and spinal cord. The neural crest is the source of the peripheral nervous system, including the neurons of the GI tract (also called the enteric nervous system).

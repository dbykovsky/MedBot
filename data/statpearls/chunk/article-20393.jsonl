Similar to SKs, a somatic activating mutation in FGFR3 has been found in lesions of DPN, supporting the concept that these two lesions share common genetic pathogenesis and may explain the genetic predisposition observed in DPN. [1] Because the lesions occur mainly in a photodistribution on the head, neck, and upper trunk, a potential association with cumulative ultraviolet (UV) exposure has been proposed. FGFR3 mutations have been found to occur more in sun-exposed regions and with increasing age. One study showed that darker-skinned patients who used topical treatments for artificial depigmentation had an exacerbation of DPNs, possibly due to decreased UV protection from loss of skin pigment.

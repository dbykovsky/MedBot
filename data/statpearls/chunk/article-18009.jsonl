It is a collection of interconnected neurons that spans from the esophagus to the rectum. Structurally, axons start over 100 nm away from the smooth muscle cells they innervate. In contrast to other areas of the peripheral nervous system, they lack a clearly defined postsynaptic area and do not form neuromuscular junctions. Excitatory and inhibitory motor neurons allow smooth muscle cells of the intestines to exist in an electrical syncytium. Control of these signals is initiated by various neurotransmitters that can produce either relaxation or contraction of these smooth muscles. Specific patterns of movement that are the result of this process create the peristalsis that transports food along the gastrointestinal tract.", "contents": "Neuroanatomy, Auerbach Plexus -- Structure and Function.

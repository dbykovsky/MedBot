A significant complication of penetrating trauma is acute compartment syndrome; this is a surgical emergency as it causes tissue ischemia and eventually necrosis.\u00a0 In general, reversible neuropraxia\u00a0can occur with ischemia time of one hour.\u00a0 If the ischemia time continues to the four-hour\u00a0mark, it correlates with irreversible axonotmesis, and if it goes longer than six hours, necrosis can occur and be irreversible.\u00a0 There are common areas within the body where compartment syndrome can occur.\u00a0 The areas that are most common include below the knee, thigh, forearm, and arm.\u00a0 Of these the most common site is below the knee.\u00a0 Studies have demonstrated that one can predict the risk of compartment syndrome based on the site of injury.\u00a0 \u00a0The risk of compartment syndrome occurring with a proximal\u00a0below the knee injury (proximal tib/fib fracture) is much high than a distal below the knee injury (middle or distal fracture).\u00a0 Fracture of the lower extremity is the leading cause of compartment syndrome.

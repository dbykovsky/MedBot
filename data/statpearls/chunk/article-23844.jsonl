[30] As such, patients with primary ciliary dysfunction\u00a0can often continue to live an active lifestyle, particularly when compliant with the management guidelines outlined above. Given the high variability of the disease, it is difficult to predict the type of decline in lung function any patient will experience. However, there are studies suggesting aggressive airway clearance and the use of antibiotics early may slow the course of the disease.\u00a0One study found that about 60% of the patients had stable\u00a0pulmonary function tests (PFTs)\u00a0in a 30-year longitudinal study. About 30% of the patients in this study suffered from a decrease in lung function. [31]"}

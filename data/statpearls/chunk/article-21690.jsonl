In bipolar implants, the femoral head is surrounded by a polyethylene liner within an acetabular shell where it can move. Unipolar implants are simpler and less expensive than bipolar types. Studies suggest that bipolar implants confer the benefits of reduced pain, less acetabular wear, and lower dislocation rates, though these types are more expensive than their unipolar counterparts. Bipolar implants are also easier to convert to a total hip replacement than unipolar types when necessary. However, evidence suggests that bipolar implants also lose movement at the inner bearing and eventually resemble a unipolar implant over time.

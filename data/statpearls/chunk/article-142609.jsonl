[41] Signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia are mainly due to a reduced supply of glucose to the central nervous system (CNS) and activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Hypoglycemia can initially cause tremors, sweating, lightheadedness, and tachycardia due to the activation of the sympathetic nervous system. CNS dysfunction due to hypoglycemia can lead to headaches, confusion, blurred vision, dizziness, seizures, and loss of consciousness. If timely measures are not taken to restore the glucose level, it can lead to serious and permanent damage to the brain, causing coma and death. [42]"}

As such, most recommendations come from an expert consensus of review of previous outbreaks. The best way to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with avian influenza is to improve public knowledge of the disease, reduce the spread of infection once an outbreak is identified, and educate vulnerable populations on risk reduction and early recognition of disease. While providers can play an essential role in this, public health officials (often through media assistance) are critical to limiting the human impact of the disease.

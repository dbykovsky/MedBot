The diabetic foot neurological exam consists of Achilles reflex testing,\u00a0Semmes-Weinstein monofilament testing (SWMT), 128 Hz tuning fork testing, and pinprick testing. The Achilles reflex is performed on bilateral Achilles tendon with a reflex hammer. Reflexes are\u00a0graded as 0+ (absent), 1+ (decreased), 2+ (brisk, normal), 3+ (increased), 4+ (increased with clonus). The 5.07/10 g SWMT is the most commonly used monofilament and examines pressure/light touch sensation. It should test for ten sites on each foot as follows:\u00a0Distal first toe, distal third toe, distal fifth toe, plantar first metatarsal head, plantar third metatarsal head, plantar fifth metatarsal head, plantar medial and lateral arch, plantar heel, and dorsal first interspace. The 128-Hz non-graduated standard tuning fork tests vibratory sensation, and an abnormal result can reveal diabetic neuropathy if the patient can no longer distinguish vibration. The pinprick can be performed with a sharp pin device and evaluates whether the patient can distinguish sharp vs. dull sensations. [23] [24] [25]"}

Treat the most bothersome symptoms first, which are usually urgent and frequent and amenable to pharmacological treatments. While post-void residual determinations are not required before initiating clinical treatment, many experts suggest checking this to avoid overlooking possible overflow incontinence. A 24-hour voiding diary (frequency/volume) can be very helpful in sorting out a complex incontinence problem.

Adjustable continence devices and artificial sphincters are underutilized procedures that should be discussed and offered to appropriate patients, especially women.", "contents": "Mixed Urinary Incontinence -- Pearls and Other Issues.

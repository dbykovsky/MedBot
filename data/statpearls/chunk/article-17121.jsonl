This light activates the photosensitizer, generating\u00a0reactive oxygen species\u00a0that selectively\u00a0destroy atypical keratinocytes. [10] PDT therapy is performed in an office-based setting. Disadvantages of conventional PDT include patients experiencing pain during the treatment, requiring an extended\u00a0period in the office during treatment sessions, and frequent office visits or treatment. These drawbacks have prompted the development of alternative uses of PDT, including daylight photodynamic therapy, where natural daylight activates the photosensitizer\u00a0instead\u00a0of an artificial light source. Daylight PDT reportedly has a similar lesion response rate to conventional PDT but with the advantages of\u00a0reduced patient discomfort and the convenience of treatment outside of the office setting.

The timeline of expected side effects of blistering, erosion, crusting, burning, discomfort, pain, pruritus, erythema, and edema must be reviewed. Additionally, patients should be educated on proper at-home care for the skin as it heals and recovers from the treatment.\u00a0Numerous treatment regimens have been reported for each of the FDA-approved medications. [16] [17] 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU):\u00a05-FU is an FDA-approved topical medication applied\u00a01 to\u00a02 times daily for several weeks. 5-FU, a pyrimidine analog, inhibits DNA synthesis and disrupts\u00a0cell division. This mechanism of action makes it one of the most effective treatments for actinic keratosis. Imiquimod (IMQ):\u00a0IMQ is an FDA-approved treatment for actinic keratosis. IMQ functions to augment the patient's immune response at the site of medicine application. [16] It is typically indicated for use on limited face and scalp areas over several weeks. Diclofenac Sodium (DFS):\u00a0DFS gel is a topical, non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory FDA-approved drug for actinic keratosis treatment. The treatment regimen involves application\u00a02 times per day for\u00a02 to\u00a03 months. DFS gel is generally better tolerated by patients than 5-FU because of milder adverse skin effects. [10] [16] Ingenol mebutate (IM):\u00a0IM is\u00a0derived from the Euphorbia peplus plant and is FDA-approved for treating actinic keratosis. The mechanism of action involves the rapid induction of keratinocyte cell death within a few hours of application. This cell death triggers an inflammatory response over the\u00a0following days, which\u00a0also has immunostimulatory effects. An advantage of IM treatment is that the duration of therapy is only a couple of days, thus significantly shorter than other topical\u00a0medications used for actinic keratosis.

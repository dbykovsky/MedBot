Pseudoaneurysm and Arteriovenous Fistula: Pseudoaneurysms (PSAs) are frequently the result of iatrogenic trauma such as biopsies or interventions and\u00a0can be intrarenal/parenchymal in location. They may remain asymptomatic and are incidentally detected or present with pain, bleeding, and/or hematuria. They present as simple or complex cystic outpouching on the grayscale US, and it is of utmost importance to\u00a0evaluate with color Doppler if you encounter renal cystic structures to rule out a vascular lesion. Color Doppler shows the \u201cyin-yang\u201d sign, which indicates bidirectional/swirling blood flow. Spectral Doppler might demonstrate the classic \u201cto-and-fro\u201d flow in the PSA neck. When a PSA is encountered, it is necessary to evaluate a surrounding hematoma, extraluminal blood flow, and an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) that might coexist. Findings suggesting the simultaneous presence of an AVF include arterialized venous flow in the draining vein indicating an abnormal direct communication between the artery and vein that is bypassing the capillary bed.

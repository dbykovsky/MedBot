In such cases, introducing the lead in the heart chamber where the displacement has occurred is a good management plan if lead extraction is not possible. This new lead cancels the effect of previously displaced lead in that chamber. [39]", "contents": "Pacemaker Malfunction -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

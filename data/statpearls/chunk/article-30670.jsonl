[26]", "contents": "Tubular Adenoma -- Differential Diagnosis. Attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis (AFAP) is a recognized variant of FAP. Patients present later in life with fewer polyps (usually 10 to 100) predominantly located in the right colon compared to classic FAP. Colorectal carcinoma develops in more than 50% of these patients but occurs later (average age, 55 years). Patients are also at risk for duodenal polyposis. However, in contrast to FAP, APC gene mutations are present in only about 30% of patients with AFAP. When present, these mutations express in an autosomal dominant pattern. Mutations in MYH, a gene involved in the repair of DNA, also result in the AFAP phenotype but are expressed in an autosomal recessive pattern. [26]"}

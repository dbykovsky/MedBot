{"id": "article-24761_2", "title": "MAST Pants -- Introduction", "content": "Despite a period of widespread use, MAST devices have been the subject of much debate and research and are currently rarely used. Initial studies in the 1970s\u00a0suggested that as much as 20% of a patient's total blood volume was auto-transfused to the upper body by application of the MAST device. [7] [8] Further studies performed in the 1980s, however, refuted these early findings, suggesting that only 5% or less of a patient\u2019s overall blood volume was auto-transfused by these devices in both human and dog models. [9] [10] During this period there were also studies that showed\u00a0harmful complications of device use which included compartment syndrome and lower extremity ischemia, amongst others. [11] In 1989, the Houston Fire Department partnered with Ben Taub Hospital to investigate the\u00a0use of MAST devices in the prehospital environment. This study, which enrolled 201 patients randomized either to MAST application or standard care, did not demonstrate an improvement in mortality rates in penetrating abdominal trauma. [12] Further studies corroborated these findings and could not show a significant difference in the length\u00a0of hospitalization or intensive care unit stay. [13] Amidst this controversy, the National Association of Emergency Medical Services Physicians published a 1997 position paper citing support for MAST in certain cases including ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, pelvic fracture with subsequent hypotension, and severe traumatic hypotension. [14] Of these recommendations, the only high-level evidence, considered Class I, existed for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. [15] In 2002, a Cochran review demonstrated an increase in intensive care unit length of stay by 1.7 days and concluded there was no evidence to suggest a reduction in mortality from the use of MAST. [5] Given these findings, many hospital systems and EMS agencies gradually abandoned the use of these devices. An article published in the United Kingdom in 1995 suggested that only 1 out of every 5 UK hospitals and 1 out of every 12 UK EMS systems continued to use these devices.

Infantile spasms are seen in approximately 90% of affected\u00a0patients in the first year of life followed by atonic, tonic, or myoclonic seizures. Increasing hemiparesis commonly accompanies seizures. Seizures progressively become refractory to medication. [3] Facial nevus (port-wine stain) is another common finding and is typically seen along the ophthalmic or maxillary segment of the trigeminal nerve (forehead, cheeks). It is typically unilateral, present at birth, and does not change with the age of the patient. [4] This appearance is in sharp contrast to the infantile hemangioma which is more common than a port-wine stain; however, it is not present at birth. It slowly grows and is followed by involution. A child with a facial port-wine stain has a 10% to 35% risk of brain involvement. If there is involvement of both upper and lower eyelids, then the risk of glaucoma increases up to 50%. Glaucoma is almost always ipsilateral to the facial port-wine stain. Not all patients with port-wine stains have Sturge-Weber syndrome. Patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome may present with cerebral symptoms without facial\u00a0findings.

Gyriform calcifications can be seen on the skull radiographs and are classically described as \"tram-track sign.\" Computed tomogram (CT) is the best modality to detect calcifications and also show the other changes such as cortical atrophy and leptomeningeal enhancement on the post-contrast studies. However, CT uses ionizing radiation, and the routine use of CT in children is not recommended. Therefore, MRI of the brain with contrast is the recommended imaging modality of choice. The most common locations are occipital and posterior parietal/temporal lobes. The MRI findings depend on the stage of the disease. In the early phase, there is transient hyperperfusion with accelerated myelin maturation, leptomeningeal enhancement (seen as serpiginous enhancement along the sulci), and restricted diffusion if there is an associated acute ischemic event. In the late phase, an increased T2 signal is seen in the region of gliosis with decreased pial enhancement and cortical atrophy. There is a lack of superficial cortical veins with prominent deep medullary/subependymal veins and enlarged choroid plexus.

[97] [98] Most commonly, lead migration occurs, causing inadequate pain relief and requiring revision and anchoring. [99] [100] Lead movement often occurs in the cervical region of the spinal cord, given an increased range of motion of the cervical vertebra. [101] [102] Spinal cord stimulator lead\u00a0fracture can occur in up to 9% of placements. [103] [104] Seromas are also very common\u00a0and may require surgical incision and drainage. [97] [105] The risk of infection following a spinal cord stimulator placement is between 2.5% and 12%. [106] [107] Lastly, direct spinal cord trauma could occur. The most significant infectious complication would be a spinal cord abscess. Dural puncture is rare but can cause a post-dural headache in up to 70% of patients. [105] [108] [109] The most critical adverse event in spinal cord stimulator placement would be a spinal epidural hematoma, which requires immediate neurosurgical decompression. The incidence of a spinal epidural hematoma is 0.71%. [110]"}

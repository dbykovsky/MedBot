The decrease is gradual and defined by the onset of deceleration to a nadir of 30 seconds or longer, with the nadir occurring at the same time as the peak of the uterine contraction. In most instances, the onset, nadir, and recovery of the deceleration coincide with the onset, peak, and end of the contraction. [2]", "contents": "Early Decelerations -- Definition/Introduction.

{"id": "article-20845_2", "title": "Early Decelerations -- Issues of Concern", "content": "An early deceleration always occurs in association with the uterine contraction. Doppler studies have shown that uterine contractions are associated with increased intrauterine pressure and a linear fall in maternal uterine artery blood flow. [3] Decelerations generally appear to be a critical fetal adaptation to intermittent hypoxia to help reduce myocardial work and oxygen requirements. [4] [5] Early decelerations, however, had been suggested to represent a non-hypoxic reflex as the result of increased intracranial pressure. [1] [6] Multiple studies of head compression in fetal sheep concluded the decelerations to result from a Cushing response secondary to reduced cerebral blood flow and increased intracranial pressure. [7] There is no evidence that mechanical compression of the fetal head by uterine contractions causes cerebral ischemia, neurologic injury, or perinatal stroke. [8] Variable decelerations are caused by direct cord compression, which leads to fetal hypertension, which in turn leads to a decreased fetal heart rate. Late decelerations following the uterine contraction result from uteroplacental insufficiency.", "contents": "Early Decelerations -- Issues of Concern.

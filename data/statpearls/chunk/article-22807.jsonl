This was demonstrated in patients with hepatorenal syndrome with normal kidney histology in addition to the absence of proteinuria. This was further demonstrated clinically when kidneys from patients with HRS were transplanted into those with chronic kidney disease as well as the improvement of renal function in liver cirrhosis patients who underwent a liver transplant.

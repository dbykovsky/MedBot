Intravenous sedation is helpful to decrease maternal discomfort and can be given according to patient preference. Propofol, dexmedetomidine, and remifentanil are commonly used for sedation either alone or in combination. General anesthesia may be needed as a backup if the operating conditions are suboptimal from maternal discomfort due to positioning or a failed regional technique."}

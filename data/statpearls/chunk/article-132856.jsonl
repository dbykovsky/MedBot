Transposition of vertical muscles (VRT) - This surgery aims to create active abduction vector forces by creating a tone for LR through the transposed muscle. [25] It is indicated in cases of esotropic DRS with minimal co-contraction. However, the transposition of both vertical muscles has several limitations. New vertical deviations have been described in 6-30% of patients after VRT, the most common being hypotropia. [26] Co-contraction may worsen after VRT. Nearly fifty percent of patients require a secondary procedure involving recession of the ipsilateral MR to achieve acceptable eye alignment and head position.

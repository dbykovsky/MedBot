Secondly, examples of anomalies of bronchi arising from nonstandard airway locations are tracheal bronchus and accessory cardiac bronchus. The tracheal bronchus, also known as pig bronchus, is a divergent additional tracheal outgrowth; it is when a bronchus arises above the carina (usually affects the right lung). [12] The accessory cardiac bronchus is a rare anomaly prevalent in males. This deviant bronchus arises from the medial wall of the bronchus intermedius and travels medially and caudally towards the mediastinum. This variant can either be working, with branches that supply oxygen to the lung parenchyma or have a short blind-ending bronchial stump with no branches."}

In cases of localized pulmonary disease, often identified through radiological imaging such as chest x-rays or computed tomography of the chest, the bronchoscope is meticulously guided to the specific affected region. Then, it is carefully wedged into the subsegment, ensuring the distal airway is ideally centered in the imaging field. Conversely, when dealing with diffuse diseases exhibiting heterogeneous patterns on imaging, the preferred sites for lavage are typically the right middle lobe or lingula. Since bronchoscopy is typically conducted with the patient lying supine, the anterior projection of these segments utilizes gravity to optimize maximal BAL. If accessibility to these segments is limited, either lower lobe's superior or anterior segment may serve as an alternative. Theoretically, this process allows for the lavage of up to 1 million alveoli. [19] [20] For patients suspected of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, the recommendation is to perform 3 sequential BALs at the same site. Visual inspection of the recovered samples is crucial, specifically assessing for any increase in hemorrhagic appearance from the first syringe to the third."}

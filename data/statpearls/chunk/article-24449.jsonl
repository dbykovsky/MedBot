{"id": "article-24449_31", "title": "Lumbar Plexus Block -- Technique or Treatment", "content": "There are some additional considerations when placing a continuous lumbar plexus catheter. While the technique of positioning the needle is the same as with a single shot lumbar plexus block, there is a small risk of catheter misplacement intravascular or neuraxial despite proper needle placement. Therefore, catheters should always be tested for negative aspiration for blood or CSF, and injection of local anesthetic should be fractionated and slow. The final positioning of the catheter should be at a depth at the skin of 4 to 5 centimeters more than the depth of the needle at its final positioning. A continuous infusion of 8 to 10 ml/hr of ropivacaine 0.2% is enough to produce excellent analgesia. If weakness precludes participation with physical therapy, the infusion rate can be reduced. Alternatively, the infusion can be increased in the event of poorly controlled pain. The development of foot drop is not a sign of excessive block and should not be mistaken as being due to the block. It is likely a surgical complication (e.g., hematoma, bone fragment, dislocation), causing sciatic compression and should be addressed urgently. The ultrasound-guided technique is beyond the scope of this review.", "contents": "Lumbar Plexus Block -- Technique or Treatment.

Reports of such cases have been documented. Therefore, regular monitoring of liver function tests is advised in patients with hepatic impairment. Moreover, hypertension is a frequent adverse effect, necessitating blood pressure monitoring. To avert the potential risk of life-threatening hyperkalemia, the recommendation is to opt for an antihypertensive medication that does not belong to the category of potassium-sparing diuretics. During the initial 3 months of monitoring, it is recommended to assess blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels for patients on a bi-weekly basis. Furthermore, regular monitoring of complete blood count, lipid profile, magnesium, and uric acid levels is advised for patients under chronic cyclosporine therapy for psoriasis.

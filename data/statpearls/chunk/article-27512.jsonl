The anterior compartment muscles function as the primary extensors of the ankle (dorsiflexion) and extensors of the toes.

The peroneal artery provides muscular branches to the lateral compartment but is, in fact, a posterior compartment structure. The lateral compartment muscles function primarily to evert the foot and weakly plantarflex the foot at the ankle.

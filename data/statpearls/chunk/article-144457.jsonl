In a cadaver study investigating the phrenic sparing volume for the anterior suprascapular nerve block, a maximum volume of 4.2 mL was identified to dye the suprascapular nerve but spared the phrenic nerve 90% of the time (MEV90). [18] While further live human studies are needed to confirm the clinical significance of this cadaveric study, avoiding phrenic blockade is essential in patients with severe pulmonary disease."}

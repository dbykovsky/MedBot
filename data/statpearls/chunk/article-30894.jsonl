Imaging in pregnancy is usually by ultrasound (see Image. Uterus Ultrasound, Molar Pregnancy). Clinicians can assess the uterus, gestational product, and the ovaries are assessable on ultrasound.

Transabdominal Long Image of a Normal Uterus and Transvaginal\u00a0Long Image of a\u00a0Normal\u00a0Uterus). The placenta, its variants can also be assessed on ultrasound. MRI imaging of the uterus during pregnancy may be necessary on rare occasions; this is usually to evaluate gestational trophoblastic disease or conditions such as endometriosis. The fetus can also undergo evaluation on MRI. Evaluation of gestational trophoblastic disease (GTN) presents a diagnostic dilemma as gadolinium contrast, which is useful in the assessment of GTN, is usually not administered during pregnancy. Gadolinium-based contrast agents can cross the placenta. Though the deleterious effects to the fetus remain unproven, it is considered to be a class C drug and usually avoided in pregnant patients unless necessary. Hence a non-contrast MRI is the norm in pregnant patients. CT and PET-CT for assessing the uterus or gynecological malignancies are associated with ionizing radiation and are contraindicated in pregnant patients. However, depending on the clinical scenario and in special circumstances where a nonionizing modality is unavailable or not useful, CT may be performed, keeping the radiation levels as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA).

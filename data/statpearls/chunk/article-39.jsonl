[32] Mortality is at least 30% in most cases. [33] Typically it occurs secondary to an erosion of the proximal suture line on the aorta through the 3rd or 4th portion in the duodenum. It is often difficult to diagnosis because the triad of sepsis, abdominal pain, and GI bleeding are not always present. There may be a smaller, self-limited \"herald-bleed\" that occurs before any massive GI bleeding. CT scan with IV contrast and upper endoscopy are sometimes helpful in diagnosis. An important part of the patient's history will include the history of aortic surgery with graft placement. When found, emergency exploratory laparotomy is necessary with graft excision, debridement of infected tissue, bowel repair/resection, and extra-anatomic bypass or new graft placement. Even if surgery is successful, there is still high mortality associated with this complication. [32] [33] [34]", "contents": "Aortofemoral Bypass -- Complications.

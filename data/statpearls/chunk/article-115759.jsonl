Twenty-eight patients who had severe and 10 patients who had very severe ocular involvement had received an amniotic membrane graft. Some patients needed AMG more than once. Patients were followed up for 3 months. They showed minimal symptomatic of dry eyes and good visual acuity. He proposed that cases classified as severe or very severe ocular SJS must have AMG within 7 to 10 days of hospitalization to avoid long term sequelae. [13] When used for pain relief in cases of pseudophakic bullous keratopathy, Pires\u00a0and colleagues reported freedom from pain in 50 out of 55 patients for 33 weeks after AMG. [14]"}

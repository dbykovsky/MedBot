Tuberculosis, which is a granulomatous infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis , may present with tree in bud opacities, cavitary lesions with a thick wall, and central hypo-enhancing necrotic nodules on CT. Organizing pneumonia presents with granulation tissue causing a consolidation or nodule with spindle-shaped margins and central necrosis. Sarcoidosis, which can affect any organ system, presents as noncaseating granulomas, bilateral perihilar opacities, honeycomb-like cysts, and fibrotic changes in a peri-bronchovascular distribution. Aspergillosis, which is a mycotic infection by Aspergillus , colonizes a preexisting cavity to form an aspergilloma. This is seen as a nodule or consolidation with either the crescent or halo signs. The crescent sign is radiolucency within the nodule, and the halo sign is when a zone of low attenuation surrounds the nodule. Another fungal infection, mucormycosis, also presents with a halo sign and crescent sign in the later stages of the disease. Granulomatosis\u00a0with polyangiitis is a necrotizing vasculitis that presents as waxing and waning parenchymal nodules with or without the halo sign and may have associated ground-glass opacities, circumferential tracheobronchial thickening, and pleural effusions. Pulmonary sequestration is a rare congenital malformation of nonfunctioning lung tissue typically seen as a heterogeneous or homogeneous soft-tissue mass. Schwannoma, a benign mesenchymal tumor in Schwann cells, presents as homogeneous or heterogeneous enhancement with cystic degeneration or hemorrhage.

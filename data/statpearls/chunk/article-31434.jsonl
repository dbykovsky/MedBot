Through a series of reactions, the purines, guanine monophosphate (GMP), and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) get converted into either hypoxanthine or xanthine. The breakdown reaction of hypoxanthine and xanthine is catalyzed by xanthine oxidase into the uric acid. Uric acid then gets converted by the enzyme uricase into allantoin, a water-soluble molecule excreted in the urine. This enzyme is vital to mammalian cells as cell turnover is a constant process throughout the body, and endogenous or ingested purines are continually being degraded and renewed. Another form of xanthine oxidase is xanthine dehydrogenase (XD). Both forms are inter-convertible and catalyze the same reactions. However, they do differ in the cofactors used; where XO uses oxygen as a substrate, XD requires NADH to carry out the same reaction.

{"id": "article-31434_5", "title": "Biochemistry, Xanthine Oxidase -- Pathophysiology", "content": "The deficiency of xanthine oxidase leads to a condition called hereditary xanthinuria type 1, attributed to a mutation in the XDH gene that leads to decreased amounts of xanthine oxidase production. Although rare, this condition can have detrimental effects on the individual, whereby a decreased metabolism of xanthine leads to elevated systemic levels of xanthine. The xanthine precipitates in the renal tubules and forms the rare xanthine kidney stones. If left untreated, this obstructs the renal parenchyma and can result in life-threatening renal failure. Patients also complain of recurrent episodes of muscle aches and joint pain. Patients with hereditary xanthuria type 1 are advised to limit their intake of proteins such as those found in meat products; this prevents the buildup of excess xanthine from protein breakdown and prevents the disease from worsening into a more severe state. Patients with type 2 of the condition have a normal expression of the XDH gene, but the final protein product fails to incorporate a sulfur molecule into its core, which ultimately limits the functionality of the protein. The symptoms of type 1 and type 2 hereditary xanthinuria are the same.\u00a0 Studies have also indicated that patients with higher levels of XDH gene expression have a direct link to the survival rates of\u00a0certain cancers.

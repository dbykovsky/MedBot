If a patient utilizes CIC to empty the bladder, a TURP can allow for easier catheterization and less hematuria. Abscess management requires drainage, as it is difficult for antibiotics to penetrate the abscess cavities, especially in protected organs like the prostate. When patients have obstructive azoospermia due to ejaculatory duct obstruction, a transurethral incision or resection of the intraurethral portion of the duct can relieve the blockage and restore normal male fertility.", "contents": "Transurethral Resection of the Prostate -- Clinical Significance. The clinical significance of a TURP is typically to relieve blockage due to obstructive enlargement of the prostate, but it can also unroof prostatic abscesses and relieve ejaculatory duct obstructions. The importance of a TURP for bladder outlet obstruction is to prevent obstructive nephropathy and bladder damage, LUTS, and UTIs due to incomplete emptying.

The average reported degree of improvement is 85%. Men with the greatest degree of bother from their urinary symptoms generally reported the best outcomes. Urinary peak flow rates typically increase more than 100% after TURP, with an average increase in peak flow rate of an additional 10 mL/sec. Effective bladder capacity increases an average of 45% by six months post-TURP, and bladder instability is decreased by 50%.", "contents": "Transurethral Resection of the Prostate -- Clinical Significance.

Because of this, appropriate indications and discussion of the complications associated with the procedure require an integrated interprofessional team to communicate effectively and initiate treatment plans so the patient and family have appropriate expectations.

Although both bypassing agents differ in their pharmacokinetics and biochemical properties, neither has shown to be more effective over the other in clinical settings. Some studies do suggest that rFVIIa should be preferred over aPCC. However, the cost aspect of rFVIIa is a downside to its\u00a0widespread usage. [12] The recommended dosage of aPCC is 100 U/kg per dose or 200 u/kg/day. In contrast, the dosage of rFVIIa is similar to the one used in congenital hemophilia, i.e., 90 \u03bcg/kg every 2\u20133 hours until sufficient hemostasis has been achieved.

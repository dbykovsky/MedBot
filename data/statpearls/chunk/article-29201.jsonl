[1] A potassium level greater than 5 mEq/L qualifies as hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia is often asymptomatic; however, it may cause fatigue, muscle cramps, muscle weakness, rarely paralysis. A high potassium level is associated with an increase in morbidity and mortality, especially K > 6.5 mEq/L can be fatal. Hence, prompt management is essential to avoid serious consequences. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate helps by removing extra potassium from the body. Due to its slow onset of action, it is a second-line agent in emergent situations. Data on the non-FDA-approved use of this drug is limited. This drug can also help to remove excess calcium, sodium from solutions in technical applications.

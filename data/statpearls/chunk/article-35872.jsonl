In patients with epididymitis, pain improves within several days of treatment, but the induration\u00a0may last weeks or months. Some people with diabetes may develop an abscess leading to sepsis, which is a potential consequence. In patients who developed epididymitis secondary to sexual activity, the partner needs to be referred and treated to stop the cycle of transmission. For patients with a diagnosis of testicular torsion, the diagnosis depends on early diagnosis and treatment.

It belongs to the family called thiazolidinediones. It is capable of lowering the glucose levels by improving target cell response to insulin without increasing the stimulation and release of insulin by the pancreatic beta cells. This drug acts by activating the nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated (PPAR) receptor gamma; the primary role of this intracellular receptor appears to be regulating adipogenesis along with glucose and metabolism. Rosiglitazone use can be as monotherapy or in combination with other oral hypoglycemic drugs, such as metformin or sulfonylureas. Rosiglitazone is a very potent thiazolidinedione; it has a binding affinity for PPAR-gamma 30-fold higher than pioglitazone. [1]", "contents": "Rosiglitazone -- Indications.

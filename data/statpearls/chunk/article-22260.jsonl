Glaucoma is a condition marked by the gradual loss of peripheral vision and irreversible damage to the optic nerve and retinal ganglion cells, making it a significant public health concern. Its multifactorial etiology involves anatomical, genetic, vascular, and immune factors. Glaucoma is a fundamental public health concern, considering that, after cataracts, it is the second cause of irreversible blindness. Currently affecting over 60 million individuals worldwide, this number is expected to surpass 110 million by 2040. [59] POAG is the most prevalent type, affecting approximately 2% to 4% of individuals aged 40 and older and around 10% of those aged 75 and older. [60]"}

Glaucoma is not a benign disorder, and if left untreated, it can lead to permanent vision loss.

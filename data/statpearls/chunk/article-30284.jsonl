An incision is made in the anterior tracheal wall at a level dictated by the lower extent of the tumor. The trachea is divided obliquely, leaving a short anterior wall and a long posterior wall; this bevels the lateral tracheal walls superiorly to enlarge the final stoma. Next, the distal trachea is sutured to the skin edges of the\u00a0chest with interrupted nylon sutures. Some surgeons will also place a permanent suture from the anterior trachea to the manubrium to relieve tension on the stomal suture line. Finally, the party wall between the proximal trachea and larynx\u00a0is dissected from the cervical esophagus by sharp dissection up to the cricoid cartilage."}

After opening the mucosa to enter the pharynx, the mucosal incision is continued along the periphery of the larynx until the opening is large enough to permit the introduction of a retractor in the pharynx. Subsequent mucosal cuts are made under direct visualization with Metzenbaum scissors, leaving a gross margin from the visible tumor. Circumferential mucosal margins are sent for a frozen section to confirm oncologic resection.", "contents": "Total Laryngectomy -- Technique or Treatment.

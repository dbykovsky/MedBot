Although the exact cause of the increased pH and bacterial overgrowth leading to BV remains incompletely understood, there are preventive measures that women can adopt to minimize the overgrowth of G vaginalis . Healthcare providers should offer comprehensive education to women regarding the risk factors associated with BV, which encompass, but are not limited to, engaging in multiple sexual partners, douching, lack of condom usage, smoking, and having female sexual partners. By reducing these risks, a resultant decrease in BV incidence could potentially contribute to lowering the acquisition of other STIs and mitigating complications that may arise from G vaginalis overgrowth.", "contents": "Gardnerella Vaginalis -- Deterrence and Patient Education.

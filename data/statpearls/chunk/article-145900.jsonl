The diagnosis of sepsis can be complex due to the broad differential diagnosis, which requires a combination of clinical evaluation, vital signs, and laboratory data using various screening tools such as SIRS, qSOFA, SOFA, NEWS, and MEWS. A laboratory workup, including CBC, chemistry panel, LFTs, and biomarkers such as blood lactate, is essential for diagnosis, risk stratification, and prognosis of sepsis. The SOFA score is used to define sepsis and has diagnostic and prognostic value. Evaluation for the source of infection, severity assessment, treatment and prevention of hypotension, intravenous fluids, vasopressors, antibiotics, and infection source control are essential in managing patients with suspected sepsis."}

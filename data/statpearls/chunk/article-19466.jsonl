In most of the cases, do not intensify statin therapy for patients who are on moderate-intensity statin therapy. The efficacy of statin therapy should undergo evaluation in six to eight weeks after the initiation. Statin therapy management should take place when statin-induced muscle adverse events, elevated aminotransferase, or renal dysfunction such as proteinuria have developed. However, routine monitoring of serum creatine kinase (CK) levels is not currently a reocmmendation for patients on statins.\u00a0For medical practitioners,\u00a0obtaining a baseline CK level should be considered before initiating statin therapy. Education on lifestyle modification, medication compliance, and awareness of new onset of muscle discomforts or weakness is crucial."}

The currently recommended treatment strategy for cystine stone formers is based on a progressive approach, starting with the most conservative measures. Initial therapy involves dietary measures, hydration, and alkalinization. In refractory cases, treatment is extended to thiol-based medications. Existing cystine stones are treated similarly to other urinary calculi of similar size, with consideration being given to the high stone recurrence rate and relative resistance to extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) fragmentation."}

The Ladd procedure includes a reduction of volvulus, lysis of Ladd bands, placing the small bowel in the right abdomen and the colon in the left abdomen, and an appendectomy. Diagnostic imaging modality depends on the hemodynamic stability of the patient. If the child is stable, a radiologist may perform an upper gastrointestinal contrast series. Presentation for intestinal malformation in older children and adults is more variable and may not present with classic bilious emesis but instead present as chronic abdominal pain with intermittent vomiting. At the time of surgical intervention, frankly, necrotic bowel is resected, while gut that may be viable is evaluated at a second-look procedure within 24 hours. Asymptomatic malrotation discovered during imaging is corrected by many surgeons with elective surgery, often utilizing the laparoscopic approach.", "contents": "Midgut Malrotation -- Pearls and Other Issues.

These include diseases and disorders, the most significant being hormonal deficiencies. Endocrine disorder: The major medical cause of short stature is growth hormone deficiency (GHD). This may be categorized as an endocrine disorder. Growth hormones regulate human growth. The growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) released by the hypothalamus stimulates the production and secretion of growth hormone (GH) from the anterior pituitary. These growth hormones act on the liver and other tissue and stimulate the secretion of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which further acts on the bones and promotes endochondral ossification. Pagani et al. (2017) found a positive correlation between IGF-1 and stature, demonstrating lower levels of IGF-1 in individuals with short stature. [2] Another endocrine cause for short stature is the deficiency of androgen, causing decreased bone formation and development. Genetic disorders: Various genetic disorders affect growth, including Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, 3M syndrome, Noonan syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, Aarskog syndrome, Silver-Russell syndrome, short stature homeobox gene deficiency, etc. [7] [8] [9] [8] [7] These genetic disorders affect the growth of an individual, resulting in short stature. They are also associated with hormonal imbalances, which may manifest as ovarian insufficiency, slowed growth, lack of growth spurts at expected times, irregular menstrual cycles, etc. Bone diseases: Bone diseases affect bone growth, thus affecting the stature of the person. These diseases include achondroplasia\u00a0(short-limbed dwarfism), diastrophic dysplasia (short-limbed dwarfism), spondyloepiphyseal dysplasias (short-trunk dwarfism), rickets, etc. [10] Chronic disorders: Chronic disorders also affect the overall growth of a person, including stature. These disorders include cystic fibrosis, Crohn disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), anemia, chronic renal insufficiency, inflammatory bowel disorder, etc. Environmental pollutants: Studies have shown that exposure to environmental pollutants such as lead, cadmium, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), etc., has\u00a0been associated with reduced height.

Oligomenorrhea describes infrequent menstrual periods and cycles lasting more than 35 days. Polymenorrhea refers to frequent menstrual periods and cycles lasting less than 21 days. It is important to note that the duration of the follicular phase can differ depending on the length of the cycle, while the luteal phase is usually stable and lasts 14 days.\u00a0Based on a 28-day cycle, the follicular phase measures from the first day of menstruation (day 0) until the beginning of ovulation (day 14). When the previous menstrual cycle completes and the corpus luteum breaks down, estrogen, progesterone, and inhibin A levels decrease. This chain of events causes positive feedback to the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary and a subsequent pulsatile release of GnRH and FSH into circulation. This increase in FSH stimulates the granulosa cells of the ovaries to recruit several follicles from each ovary. These follicles complete maturation and only one Graafian follicle goes through ovulation during that cycle. The increase in FSH also stimulates the secretion of Inhibin B by the granulosa cells. Inhibin B eventually blunts the secretion of FSH toward the end of the follicular phase. Inhibin B levels\u00a0are highest during the LH surge before ovulation and quickly taper off after.

The functioning of the ovaries weakens with increasing age, which causes less inhibin production in the previous luteal phase. The decreased inhibin levels stimulate a larger release of FSH compared to that of a younger female. These increasing levels of FSH cause more active recruitment of ovarian follicles, which can increase the occurrence of more than one ovulation per cycle. Since the follicles get recruited at an increased rate, the overall duration of the follicular phase decreases, and the follicle released\u00a0for ovulation\u00a0is immature. Due to these age-related changes in the early follicular phase, physicians can assess suspected infertility by checking serum FSH and estradiol levels around day 3 of the cycle. Also, ovarian reserve can be predicted by monitoring serum levels of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) made by the granulosa cells, as this hormone plays an important role in folliculogenesis. AMH levels can be monitored at any point during the menstrual cycle. [3] [4] [5]", "contents": "Menstrual Cycle Proliferative And Follicular Phase -- Issues of Concern -- Follicular Phase.

A five-year follow-up to the STAR trial\u00a0evaluated\u00a097 participants, of which 71 chose to undergo voluntary in-lab polysomnography. In these 71 patients, the mean AHI was 12.4 events per hour and ODI 9.9 events per hour, demonstrating maintenance of initial improvements seen at the 12-month follow-up in the STAR trial. [22] Ninety-two patients completed the evaluation of patient subjective measures, with a mean ESS score of 6.9 and a FOSQ of 18. These results demonstrate the maintenance of improvements seen in the initial trial.

Studies have shown that SCT was associated with a decline in GFR and the development of albuminuria compared to those without the trait. [18] According to Niket and his colleagues, GFR decreased at 0.254 mL/min/1.73 m per year (95% CI, 0.089 to 0.418) in sickle cell trait individuals compared to noncarriers. [18] The reason for this is chronic reversible sickling induced by hypoxia in the renal medullae, leading to constant ischemia and microinfarction of the renal tubules. Ischemia of the renal medulla and tubules causes the release of vasoactive elements. These elements contribute to hyperfiltration, leading to sclerosis and proteinuria.", "contents": "Sickle Cell Trait -- Complications -- Chronic Kidney Disease.

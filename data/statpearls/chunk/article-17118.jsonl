Traumatic AC joint pain is typically the result of a direct blow to the superior or lateral aspect of the shoulder. [2] The impact results in a partial or complete tear of the ligamentous structures within the joint, more commonly known as a separated shoulder, and frequently occurs in contact sports such as football and hockey. Patients with separated shoulder often present with a notable deformity over their superior shoulder and pain directly over the AC joint.\u00a0 Traumatic AC joint pain is treated either conservatively with a sling and relative rest or with surgery if the injury is high-grade or severe.

In an article by Dicianno, the \u201cspecialty medical home\u201d is proposed as the ideal management method of spina bifida patients as a variation of the often referenced \u201cmedical home model\u201d. In the medical home model, the primary care physician serves as a central hub with all compiled medical information and acts as the referring physician managing the team dynamic between specialists. However, in certain conditions, it has been suggested that the specialty physician act as the medical home as most of the comorbidities being managed stem from the underlying condition. Dicianno recommends this specialty medical home model for spina bifida to encourage teamwork driven by a subspecialist well versed in spina bifida and its sequelae.

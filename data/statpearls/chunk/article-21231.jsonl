{"id": "article-21231_34", "title": "Epidural Morphine -- Toxicity", "content": "A morphine overdose can be life-threatening, primarily due to the risk of respiratory depression. When morphine is administered through the epidural route, it can cause delayed respiratory depression, even up to 24 hours after a single injection. In case of suspicion of overdose, it is imperative to promptly discontinue opioids or sedatives and administer intravenous naloxone to reverse the effects of morphine. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist, and its effective dose depends on the opioid dose\u00a0received. For postoperative patients, the initial dosage of naloxone is typically 0.04 mg, with the option to administer additional increments every 2 minutes if necessary, up to a maximum of 15 mg.

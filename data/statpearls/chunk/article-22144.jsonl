[1] Second, the\u00a0Law of\u00a0Segregation states that the two alleles for each gene separate from each other during gametogenesis so that the parent may only pass off one allele; thus, the offspring can only inherit one allele from each parent. Third, the\u00a0Law of\u00a0Independent\u00a0Assortment (Law of\u00a0Reassortment) states that the alleles of different genes segregate independently of one another during gametogenesis and are distributed independently of one another in the next generation.

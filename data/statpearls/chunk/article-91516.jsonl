It is considered that if gait disorder precedes mental disturbance, the chance of improvement with shunting is more than 77%. Another criterium is the response to a single lumbar puncture or external lumbar drain. Improvement of symptoms after a single lumbar puncture with 40-50 ml of CSF drained or after the lumbar drain is considered a positive predictive value for shunt success. Persistent ventricular activity 48\u00a0to 72 hours after isotopic cisternography gives more than a 75% chance of relieving the symptoms with shunt placement."}

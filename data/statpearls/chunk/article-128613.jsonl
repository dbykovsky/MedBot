Of note, the AIUM recommends evaluation of the veins from the level of the inguinal ligament to the ankle for lower extremity DVTs. Still, this practice is not entirely embraced across medical facilities.\u00a0Regardless of the institution, examination with gray-scale, CDI, SDI, and compression at the common femoral, superficial femoral, deep femoral, and popliteal veins is performed. Given the prevalence of pathology and anatomic variations, images demonstrating the common femoral vein and great saphenous vein confluence and the proximal deep femoral vein adjacent to the proximal superficial femoral vein must be obtained. If needed, the posterior tibial, peroneal, and anterior tibial veins may also be interrogated. In instances where venous reflux is suspected, images of baseline and provocative maneuvers should be recorded as well as reflux times in seconds or milliseconds. [12]"}

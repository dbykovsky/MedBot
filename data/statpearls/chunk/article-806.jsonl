These properties make Octreotide indicated for the\u00a0treatment of growth-hormone producing tumors (such as in acromegaly and gigantism), pituitary tumors that secrete thyroid-stimulating hormone, symptoms of diarrhea and flushing from carcinoid syndrome, and diarrhea in patients with VIP-secreting tumors (VIPomas).

It has poor gut absorption; therefore, parenteral administration is necessary.", "contents": "Physiology, Gastrointestinal Hormonal Control -- Clinical Significance.

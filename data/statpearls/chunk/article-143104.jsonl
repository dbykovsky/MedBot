Patients may present with decreased visual acuity, floaters, visual field defects, and metamorphopsia. They may have signs of retinal detachment on fundoscopic examination. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, but additional testing, such as OCT, FFA, and ICG, may be necessary to determine the underlying etiology. Treatment depends on the underlying cause and may include medical management with corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents, laser photocoagulation, photodynamic therapy, anti-VEGF therapy, or surgical intervention in refractory cases.", "contents": "Exudative Retinal Detachment -- Pearls and Other Issues.

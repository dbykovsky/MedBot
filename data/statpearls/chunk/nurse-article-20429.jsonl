Regular diabetic retinal exams should be performed by qualified medical personnel to assess for diabetic retinopathy. Neurological sensation examination with monofilament testing to the feet can identify patients with neuropathy at risk for amputation. Clinicians can also recommend patients perform daily foot inspections to identify foot lesions that may go unnoticed due to neuropathy. The ADA also recommends regular blood pressure screening for diabetics, with the goal being 130 mmHg systolic blood pressure and 85 mmHg diastolic blood pressure. [28] The ADA recommends regular interval lipid monitoring for patients with diabetes. [29]"}

For simplicity, it has been\u00a0described as occurring in three stages, when, in reality, it occurs on a continuum. Stage one begins when the tendon experiences the initial insult, stress, or injury. This could result from acute overload, repetitive stress, or chemical irritation by agents such as fluoroquinolones, which have been linked to the death of tenocytes. The failed healing of the tendon characterizes stage two. It is unclear what this is caused by, but a common belief is that an altered tendon environment causes improper cell recruitment and a cascade of healing. Theoretically, medications such as steroids and NSAIDs could also alter the natural healing cascade, providing short-term relief but leading to further pathology. The third stage is highlighted by apoptosis of cells, disorganization of the matrix, and neovascularization. It is at this stage that many patients present for evaluation. They may experience mechanical weakness resulting in tears or increased pain. Neovascularization has been theorized to supply neonerves, which are thought to be part of the genesis of pain in tendinosis. In the literature, this has been termed neurogenic inflammation. It has been proven that when these neovessels are sclerosed, disrupted, or destroyed, pain improves.", "contents": "Tendinosis -- Pathophysiology.

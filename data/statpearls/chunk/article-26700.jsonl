Classification of spondylolisthesis is according to the Meyerding Classification. [22] This is a measure of the percent of antero or retro slippage/transitional displacement of one vertebral body on the vertebral body below observed on lateral radiographs. Grade I less than 25% Grade II 25 to 50% Grade III 50 to 75% Grade IV 75 to 100% Grade V greater than 100% (spondyloptosis)"}

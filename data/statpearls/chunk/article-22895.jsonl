Clinical observation of abnormal gait patterns, such as antalgic gait, abductor-deficient gait (ie, Trendelenburg gait), pelvic wink, excessive internal or external rotation, short leg limp, and abnormal foot progression, must be evaluated. [19] An antalgic gait will have a shortened stance phase, indicative of hip, pelvic, or lower back pain.\u00a0A Trendelenburg gait is characteristic of abductor weakness. During the evaluation, the pelvis will drop on the contralateral side during the stance phase of gait. The gluteus medius and minimus are not strong enough to keep the pelvis level; as this weakness progresses, a compensatory weight shift toward the affected side may occur. [19] The single-leg stance phase stance is similar to the Trendelenburg test and helps identify a patient with weakened abductor muscles. Single-leg stance evaluates the mechanics of the hip abductor musculature and proprioception. [17] While standing, the patient lifts the unaffected leg forward to 45-degree hip flexion and 45-degree knee flexion while holding this position for 6 seconds.\u00a0A positive test is a pelvic shift or a decrease of >2\u00a0cm."}

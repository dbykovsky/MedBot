In arteries, the tunica media is composed of smooth muscle cells activated by various neurotransmitters, hormones, and mechanical perturbations.

Passive stretching also induces arterial smooth muscle contraction and can be of importance when describing the autoregulation of blood pressure. When an endogenous stimulus acts on a vascular smooth muscle cell, calcium (Ca++) is released either from the sarcoplasmic reticulum or from an influx across the cell membrane and binds to cytoplasmic calmodulin. The Ca++/calmodulin complex subsequently activates myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). MLCK phosphorylates myosin heads in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), thus enabling actin-myosin cross-bridge formation and smooth muscle contraction.

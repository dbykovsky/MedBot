The contraction of smooth muscle is not regulated by the binding of Ca to the troponin complex, as is seen in cardiac and skeletal muscle contraction. Smooth muscle instead utilizes calmodulin, an intracellular second messenger that binds calcium. Smooth muscle contraction initiation and execution occur in the following steps. Intracellular Ca concentration increases when calcium enters the cell and is released from the SR. Calcium binds to calmodulin. Ca-calmodulin activates myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). MLCK phosphorylates myosin head light chains and increases myosin ATPase activity. Active myosin cross-bridges slide along actin and create muscle tension. Smooth muscle relaxation occurs as free Ca in the cytosol decreases when Ca is pumped out of the cell or back into the SR. Ca unbinds from calmodulin. Myosin phosphatase removes phosphate from myosin, decreasing myosin ATPase activity and muscle tension."}

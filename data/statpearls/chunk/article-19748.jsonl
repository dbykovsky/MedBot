Misinterpretation of patterns is the most common error in colposcopy. A flat, mild acetowhite grade 1 lesion is more likely to be overdiagnosed as these findings mimic immature or active metaplastic epithelium in young women, regenerative epithelium, subclinical HPV infection, and congenital transformation zone. If in doubt, such lesions must be biopsied. Colposcopy should be avoided during the regenerative period of epithelium following CO 2 laser ablation, cryosurgery, or trauma. Another common error is making a diagnosis without completely visualizing the cervix in cases where it is obscured by an endocervical polyp or large retention cyst, or there is a stenosed internal os, and in cases of incomplete visibility of the SCJ.", "contents": "Colposcopy -- Complications -- Sources of Error in Colposcopy.

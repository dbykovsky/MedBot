If a lesion in the dorsal pontine tegmentum is more extensive than the size of the CN\u00a0VI nucleus and damages both the ipsilateral abducens nucleus and MLF, then the ipsilateral lateral rectus muscle and bilateral medial rectus muscles will be impaired. From the ipsilateral CN\u00a0VI nucleus, CN\u00a0VI fibers arise and travel to the ipsilateral lateral rectus muscle. In contrast, the interneuron fibers arising from the ipsilateral nucleus cross the midline and project through the contralateral MLF and synapse to the contralateral CN\u00a0III nucleus. The ipsilateral MLF, to which the contralateral CN\u00a0VI fibers project, is responsible for the synapse on the ipsilateral CN\u00a0III nucleus, which innervates the ipsilateral medial rectus muscle. For example, when the lesion affects both the right CN\u00a0VI nucleus and MLF fibers, the right lateral rectus and left medial rectus muscles associated with the right CN\u00a0VI fibers will be impaired. The right medial rectus muscle, which is innervated by the right CN\u00a0III that can no longer receive signals from the right damaged MLF, will also be impaired. As a result, when the examiner asks a patient to look to the right, the patient will seem to be looking straight ahead. When instructing a patient to look to the left, the patient\u2019s left eye will look to the side, whereas the right eye cannot move to the left and look straight ahead."}

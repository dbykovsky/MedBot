{"id": "article-23027_4", "title": "Human Insulin -- Mechanism of Action", "content": "Insulin\u2019s significant actions focus on storing excess energy in a fed state. Insulin promotes glycogen synthesis, lipid synthesis, protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, and cellular growth and differentiation. Once glucose gets absorbed from a meal, it enters the blood, and then the pancreas releases insulin. Insulin synthesis occurs in the beta cells of the pancreas initially as preproinsulin.\u00a0Preproinsulin then converts to proinsulin, which then transforms into a single peptide with A, B, and C peptide units. The A and B peptides are joined by disulfide bonds to make insulin and\u00a0are secreted into the bloodstream. Insulin binds to its cellular receptor.\u00a0The insulin receptor is composed of alpha subunits, beta subunits, and a tyrosine kinase enzyme. When insulin binds to the alpha subunit, this triggers phosphorylation and activation of the target proteins intracellularly by the tyrosine kinase leading to many effects on cellular metabolism. Activation of the insulin receptor also leads to increased expression of GLUT (a glucose transporter) to the membrane surface and promotes the entry of glucose to the intracellular compartment and then undergoes cellular metabolism. Insulin signals glucose conversion to glycogen for storage and the formation of acetyl coenzyme A and triacylglycerol, which get stored in adipose tissue. Also, insulin directs amino acids for protein synthesis. [3]", "contents": "Human Insulin -- Mechanism of Action. Insulin\u2019s significant actions focus on storing excess energy in a fed state.

CRAO is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes ER triage nurses. Clinicians need to know that CRAO is a medical emergency. There were no treatments for this condition in the past, but now numerous series indicate that HBO therapy may help. Thus, triage and rapid transfer of these patients to an HBO chamber is paramount if vision is to be saved. Fundoscopy should be performed and documented immediately. An ophthalmologist should be consulted, preferably a vitreoretinal specialist. Ideally, patients with CRAO are evaluated by a stroke team (neurology). Patients with CRAO with symptom duration of less than 6 to 8 hours have the best outcomes after HBO therapy. [4] [33] [4]"}

During embryonic development, there are various stages the heart undergoes to become functional. Around 18 days after fertilization, the primitive heart begins developing from 2 bilateral tubes that are found on the immature, disc-like embryo. Next, the embryo folds, allowing the 2 tubes to fuse in the midline forming a single heart tube. The primitive atria and ventricles are structurally found between the sinus venosus and the bulbus cordis. During the fourth week of development, the heart tube begins looping to form a shape that more closely resembles the adult heart.", "contents": "Embryology, Atrioventricular Septum -- Development.

Around this time, endocardial cushions are formed by deposition of extracellular matrices and cell proliferation and migration.

For example, the atrioventricular cushions are derived from adjacent endocardial cells; conotruncal cushions are derived from neural crest cells. The atrioventricular endocardial cushions are formed at the ventral and dorsal borders of the atrioventricular (AV) canal. The primitive atrioventricular\u00a0canal only has access to the primitive left ventricle with a bulboventricular flange to separate it from the bulbus cordis. With time, the posterior flange shrinks and becomes less prominent. The atrioventricular\u00a0canal enlarges to the right, allowing blood flow to both primitive right and left ventricles.

Understanding sliding genioplasty is imperative for those performing chin augmentation, particularly concerning relevant anatomy and principles for patients with microgenia or retrognathia. [12]", "contents": "Facial Chin Augmentation -- Technique or Treatment -- Intraoral Approach. When opting for an intraoral approach, a gingivolabial incision of 2 to 3 cm is made, followed by a similar dissection through the mentalis muscle down to the periosteum. The implant is then placed in a supraperiosteal plane centrally, while the lateral wings are positioned sub-periosteally. Maintaining dissection along the inferior aspect of the mandible helps minimize the risk of mental nerve injury. Following this, the wound is thoroughly irrigated with antibiotic solution, and layers of closure are performed using absorbable sutures, ensuring meticulous approximation of the mentalis and creating a water-tight seal.

[14] [15] The following tips can help to avoid complications: Maintaining a small supraperiosteal strip centrally to limit bony resorption. Dissecting a narrow subperiosteal plane laterally to accommodate the chosen implant, thereby limiting implant migration snugly. Staying along the inferior border of the mandible reduces mental nerve injury and promotes an aesthetically positioned implant.

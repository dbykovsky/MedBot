This device has given people once deemed deaf, the ability to hear once again, which is a\u00a0profound medical accomplishment.\u00a0All age ranges may benefit from this device, which impacts the patients differently at different stages of life. In the elderly population, patients with severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss\u00a0have been shown to lead to dementia at an earlier age compared to peers. The social isolation associated with acquired hearing loss in elderly individuals, the significant decline in quality of life, and increases in emotional handicaps are risk factors leading to cognitive decline which show improvement with cochlear implants for appropriately selected patients. [18] Hearing aids have been shown to prevent progression to dementia and even reverse mild cognitive impairment. [19] Research suggests that cochlear implants may extend a patient's life, as dementia may lead to an earlier death compared to peers."}

Although educational costs for all implanted\u00a0patients remain\u00a0increased compared to children without hearing impairment, the ultimate achievement of educational independence for most implanted children produces net savings that range from $30000 to $100000 per child, including the costs associated with initial cochlear implantation and postoperative rehabilitation. [20] The ultimate goal is to perform bilateral cochlear implant insertion for children as this has been shown to improve learning in children and provides a more natural listening experience for a patient. [21] In summary, cochlear implants allow speech development, speech restoration (postlingually deaf), restoration of hearing (which has numerous implications from safely crossing the street in traffic and increased quality of life such as listening to music), integration into regular classroom settings, and the potential for increased earning potential. Hearing aids are customizable to an individual, and after successful implantation, the audiology team works with the patient to adjust implant settings to fulfill best the daily requirements a user may need.

An international neurologist panel developed criteria for paraneoplastic syndrome affecting the nervous system into definite and possible categories based on the classical neurological syndrome, presence of paraneoplastic antibodies, and timing of diagnosis of the occult malignancy. [26] [27] Classical syndromes include encephalomyelitis, limbic encephalitis, subacute cerebellar degeneration, opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome, Lambert Eaton myasthenic syndrome, subacute sensory syndrome neuropathy, chronic gastrointestinal pseudoobstruction, and dermatomyositis. Definite Paraneoplastic Syndrome : a classical neurological syndrome with confirmed paraneoplastic syndrome antibodies where malignancy, if undiagnosed, is expected to be diagnosed within five years of the diagnosis of paraneoplastic syndrome."}

Identifying intrathecal synthesis of HSV-specific IgM antibodies can be valuable for diagnosing HSV encephalitis, especially when the CSF samples are unavailable or only available more than 1 week after treatment initiation. [17] Relying solely on serum serology is ineffective in diagnosing HSV encephalitis due to the high prevalence of HSV antibodies (IgG) in the general population. CSF antibodies to purified HSV glycoprotein B have a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 100%. Though a four-fold rise in viral antibody titers is expected to occur during the course of the illness, the initial detection is possible only after 10\u00a0to 14 days of illness, thereby helping only in late diagnosis. Routine blood tests include CBC, coagulation studies, and basic metabolic panel. These may show an elevated WBC with lymphocytosis or be within normal limits."}

Short-term complications include cerebral edema, status epilepticus, increased intracranial pressure, aspiration pneumonitis, cerebral venous thrombosis, cerebral infarction, and diabetes insipidus. Long-term sequelae include neurological deficits with varying severity (ie, aphasia, ataxia, dysphasia, amnesia) and cognitive, behavioral, physical, and neuropsychiatric abnormalities. About 70% of patients report long-term behavioral and cognitive issues. [5]"}

Shark bites are not common, but when they do occur, they are either fatal at the site or the individual suffers serious injury, including amputation of the limb. The management of shark bites is more difficult as many encounters occur at sea away from expert medical assistance. Like any trauma, the priority is to resuscitate the patient with priorities on the airway, breathing, and circulation. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of evidence in the scientific literature to help guide the management of shark-related trauma.

Tachycardia refers to a heart rate that is >100 beats per minute. The QRS complex represents ventricular depolarization on the EKG. To briefly explain some cardiac anatomy, a normal heartbeat is generated by an electrical stimulus that originates in the sino-atrial (SA) node. This stimulus then travels from the SA node to the atrioventricular (AV) node. The normal conduction pathway for this electrical stimulus (which represents the QRS) is from the AV node down the bundle of His, Purkinje fibers, and then into the ventricular myocardium which causes them to contract (depolarize). The pathway just described is considered anterograde and orthodromic because it follows the normal conduction circuit. When there are structural changes of the heart that can create alternative conduction pathways, this can cause the electrical stimulus to go in reverse and would then be called retrograde and antidromic. Depending on which pathway the electrical stimulus takes, it will affect how the QRS complex will be visualized on the EKG. A normal QRS should be less than 0.12 seconds (120 milliseconds), therefore a wide QRS will be greater than or equal to 0.12 seconds.

For example, VT (with pulses) is normally treated with either anti-arrhythmic medications or electrical cardioversion. If one were to mistake Afib for VT and treat with electrical cardioversion, this could have some serious consequences. When the atria beat irregularly/spastically, this increases the risk of clot formation on the atrial walls. A patient who is not anti-coagulated and was to receive cardioversion in the setting of Afib, their risk of possible stroke will be 1.5% due to clot dislodgement.

Adenosine effectively resolves tachycardia caused by SVT by blocking electrical conduction through the AV node. Giving adenosine in VT can effectively slow the rate which\u00a0can aid in diagnosis and in some rare instances, can\u00a0cardiovert. [12] [13]", "contents": "Wide QRS Complex Tachycardia -- Treatment / Management. If a patient is clinically stable and time permits, knowing the cause of their WCT will allow the physician to correctly treat/manage the etiology and further reduce the potential risk for morbidity and mortality. For example, VT (with pulses) is normally treated with either anti-arrhythmic medications or electrical cardioversion. If one were to mistake Afib for VT and treat with electrical cardioversion, this could have some serious consequences. When the atria beat irregularly/spastically, this increases the risk of clot formation on the atrial walls. A patient who is not anti-coagulated and was to receive cardioversion in the setting of Afib, their risk of possible stroke will be 1.5% due to clot dislodgement. [11] Another example is mistaking VT for SVT. As stated previously, SVT can be managed conservatively with vagal maneuvers or with medications (i.e. adenosine, diltiazem, verapamil). Adenosine effectively resolves tachycardia caused by SVT by blocking electrical conduction through the AV node. Giving adenosine in VT can effectively slow the rate which\u00a0can aid in diagnosis and in some rare instances, can\u00a0cardiovert. [12] [13]"}

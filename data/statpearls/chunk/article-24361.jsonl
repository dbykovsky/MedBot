Empiric antibiotic coverage is essential when the organism is unknown. The antibiotics should cover Enterobacteriaceae, anaerobes, streptococci, enterococci, and Entamoeba histolytica. Such antibiotic regimens include cephalosporins plus metronidazole, Beta-lactam Beta-Lactamase inhibitor plus metronidazole, or synthetic penicillins plus aminoglycosides and metronidazole. Alternatively, fluoroquinolones or carbapenems can be substituted for cephalosporins or penicillins in case of allergy or unavailability. Metronidazole should cover\u00a0Entamoeba histolytica. The duration of treatment varies but is usually from two to six weeks. After initial intravenous treatment, the oral route can be used safely in most cases to complete the course.\u00a0Culture results help narrow down the organism, so empiric treatment is no longer needed, as it can lead to antibiotic resistance. Anaerobes are hard to culture, so sometimes they should be treated for the entire course empirically. For stable patients, antibiotics can be given post-drainage to increase culture yield for proper treatment. Empiric antifungal treatment is crucial in immunosuppressed patients with a risk for chronic disseminated fungemia.\u00a0Occasionally if the patient is too sick for drainage, antibiotics are used solely for treatment, but this is a less desirable method."}

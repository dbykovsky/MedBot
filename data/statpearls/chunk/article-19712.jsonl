Spironolactone is primarily used for hypertension control, but it may also be used as an adjunct to conventional heart failure regimens. To lessen hyperkalemia risk, a thiazide diuretic may be given concurrenty to lower spironolactone dosage. Spironolactone is highly efficacious but can exert potentially distressing antiandrogenic effects in men like gynecomastia and erectile dysfunction.

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome is one of the significant respiratory consequences related to obesity.

Therefore, serum bicarbonate levels can be a sensitive test to screen for chronic hypercapnia. The percent of total sleep time with SpO2 spent below 90% can be a useful polysomnographic variable for evaluating OHS patients.

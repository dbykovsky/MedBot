Breastfeeding concomitantly to receiving nivolumab therapy is discouraged as antibodies might be passed onto the breast milk. Studies evaluating the fertility of patients receiving nivolumab have not yet been published; it remains unknown whether nivolumab affects either female or male fertility. Patients should be thoroughly informed on this matter, and reproductive counseling should be offered to patients in reproductive age groups. Although preexisting conditions of an autoimmune or inflammatory nature are not a contraindication for nivolumab therapy, it has been reported that such patients have increased rates of immunosuppressive therapy and hospitalization after ICI treatment.

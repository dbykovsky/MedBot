No shielding and no wedges or lead blocks were used for reducing scattered radiation. It was later estimated that the fetus was exposed to a dose of 0.39 Gy. A healthy baby was delivered at term through standard vaginal delivery without complications. The first trimester is unsafe due to known incidences of severe malformations and mental retardation. During the third trimester, the grown fetus in a growing gravid uterus is also at risk of increased dose due to the reduced distance between the treatment field and the gravid uterus. Hence the fetal exposure increases with the gestational stage as the distance between the radiation field edge and uterine fundus narrows by around a centimeter per week. Thus, it is recommended to evaluate the expected change during radiotherapy while calculating the fetal dose.

Hence, exposure dose is of low risk, especially in the late second and third trimester, when the risk of malformations is far lower. Antypas et al., while treating a 45 yr-old patient with 46 Gy in 20 fractions with six\u00a0megavolts tangential fields, found her to be pregnant during the second week of her treatment. [34] She was continually irradiated during the 2nd and 6th week of gestation. Fetal doses were estimated utilizing both in vivo and phantom set-up with thermoluminescence dosimeters and an ionization chamber. No shielding and no wedges or lead blocks were used for reducing scattered radiation. It was later estimated that the fetus was exposed to a dose of 0.39 Gy. A healthy baby was delivered at term through standard vaginal delivery without complications. The first trimester is unsafe due to known incidences of severe malformations and mental retardation. During the third trimester, the grown fetus in a growing gravid uterus is also at risk of increased dose due to the reduced distance between the treatment field and the gravid uterus. Hence the fetal exposure increases with the gestational stage as the distance between the radiation field edge and uterine fundus narrows by around a centimeter per week. Thus, it is recommended to evaluate the expected change during radiotherapy while calculating the fetal dose. [35] Also, note that using physical wedges during tangential breast irradiation can significantly escalate scattering and should therefore be avoided. Physical wedges are ordinarily used to improve dose uniformity to the target volume."}

For relatively rare occurrences of poorly differentiated or anaplastic thyroid cancer during pregnancy, aggressive therapy is warranted with the patient informed decision-making and constant communication within the multi-disciplinary team.", "contents": "Radiation Effects On The Fetus -- Clinical Significance -- Thyroid Cancer. Thyroid cancer is another common cancer commonly seen in women of the reproductive age group. Surgery is the primary treatment for well-differentiated thyroid cancers. However, it is prudent to postpone surgery during pregnancy until after delivery and keep a watchful follow-up using ultrasound imaging and thyroid function tests unless progression is evident. Thyroid malignancies are not generally treated using external beam radiotherapy. Instead, radioactive iodine (131-I) is often used to ablate residual thyroid tissue after surgery in non-pregnant cases. Radioactive 131-I is contraindicated during pregnancy, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission recommends not to breastfeed while being treated with radioactive iodine. For relatively rare occurrences of poorly differentiated or anaplastic thyroid cancer during pregnancy, aggressive therapy is warranted with the patient informed decision-making and constant communication within the multi-disciplinary team."}

[21] The half-life of the CA125 antigen is reported to have an additional prognostic value. A half-life of less than 20 days is associated with improved survival compared to a half-life of more than 20 days. [26] Normalization of CA125 levels after\u00a03 cycles of combination therapy also correlates with improved survival. Importantly,\u00a0CA125 concentration is not elevated in 10% to 20% of patients with advanced ovarian cancer. For these patients, using radiological imaging techniques and monitoring other tumor markers\u00a0are necessary. [42]"}

QC samples should be assayed after calibration or maintenance of an analyzer to verify the correct method performance. [43] To minimize QC when performing tests for which manufacturers\u2019 recommendations are less than those required by the regulatory agency, such as once per month, the labs can develop an individualized quality control plan (IQCP). This plan involves performing a risk assessment of potential sources of error in all testing phases and putting in place a QC plan to reduce the likelihood of mistakes.

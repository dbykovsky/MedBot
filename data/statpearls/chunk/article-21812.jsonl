Using insect growth regulators such as pyriproxyfen inhibits adult reproduction and blocks the organogenesis of immature larval stages via hormonal or enzymatic actions. Combining an insecticide and an insect growth regulator appears to be most effective in synergistic actions against adult fleas and larvae. There have been reports of insecticidal resistance in the flea population, especially with pyrethroids. A professional exterminator and veterinarian should be consulted. In recalcitrant cases, evaluation for other wild mammals or birds should be performed in unoccupied areas of the home, such as the attic, crawl spaces, basements, and inside walls. [3]"}

Patients with a high risk of secondary infection and patients with extensive infections should receive treatment with prophylactic antibiotics. Unvaccinated patients face an increased risk of tetanus, so the practitioner should ask all patients about their tetanus status. Conventional therapy is the surgical extraction of the parasite under sterile conditions.

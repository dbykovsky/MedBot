To determine the degree of stenosis, the velocity ratio is assessed. The peak systolic velocity ratio between the stenotic lesion and the unaffected section of the vessel is used to calculate this ratio. A ratio of 1.5 to 2 indicates 30% to 49% stenosis, while ratios of 2 to 4 and above 4 indicate 50% to 75% and over 75% stenosis, respectively. The accuracy of limb\u00a0arterial DUS varies depending on the scanned segment and levels involved. However,\u00a0DUS is highly accurate in grading peripheral arterial disease, with a relative accuracy of over 80% compared to CT angiography. According to another classification, a peripheral arterial lesion is significant if it causes over 50% stenosis in the presence of an atherosclerotic plaque.

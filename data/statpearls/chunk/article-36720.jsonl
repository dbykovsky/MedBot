However, patients with higher degrees of an AV block (Mobitz type 2 AV block, 3rd degree) tend to have severe damage to the conduction system. They are usually at a greater risk of progressing into asystole, ventricular tachycardia, or sudden cardiac death. Hence, they require urgent admission for cardiac monitoring and further evaluation.

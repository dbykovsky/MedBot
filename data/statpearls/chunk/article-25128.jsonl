The first is the squamous metaplasia theory, which suggests that inflammation causes the mucosal lining of the middle ear to become hyperproliferative. The second major theory postulates that squamous epithelium from the outer layer of the tympanic membrane migrates through a perforation through the drum and into the middle ear. Basal hyperplasia theory is the third theory, which assumes that basal cells of the tympanic membrane proliferate and move medially through the basement membrane into the middle ear. The fourth and final theory is the retraction pocket theory, which is accepted by many otolaryngologists. So much so, in fact, that cholesteatoma resulting from a retraction pocket is named primary acquired cholesteatoma [1] [2] . A secondary acquired cholesteatoma is formed by infection, trauma, or surgical manipulation causing implantation of skin into the middle ear through a defect in the eardrum. Despite these distinct categories, there may be a component of all four theories involved in the disease.

One of the most common problems is hearing loss due to the erosion of the middle ear bones.

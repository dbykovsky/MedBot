Dental caries\u00a0occurs when the biofilm microbiota that normally resides in the oral cavity in homeostasis changes to an acidogenic, aciduric, and cariogenic population due to the frequent consumption of sugars. [2] The result of this shift can be clinically invisible or lead to a net mineral loss within the tooth's hard structures, resulting in a visible carious lesion - a white spot. [1] If plaque control measures are performed, the lesion can regress without the need for invasive intervention. Existing caries should be initially managed by non-invasive procedures (eg, remineralization, biofilm removal, sealing) instead of removing dental tissue. Cavitated lesions should be arrested or controlled following a minimally invasive approach, e.g., repairing a defective restoration instead of replacing it. [2] Dentists should undertake a conservative approach when treating dental caries, and professionals from other dental specialties should detect early carious lesions and make appropriate referrals promptly to improve patients' outcomes.", "contents": "Dental Caries -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

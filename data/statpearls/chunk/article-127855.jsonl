Interventional techniques can also be utilized in the treatment of chronic pain. Spinal cord stimulation, epidural steroid injections, radiofrequency nerve ablations, botulinum toxin injections, nerve blocks, trigger point injections, and intrathecal pain pumps are some procedures and techniques commonly used to combat chronic pain. TENS units' efficacy has been variable, and the results of TENS units for chronic pain management are inconclusive. [91] Deep brain stimulation is for post-stroke and facial pain as well as severe, intractable pain\u00a0where other treatments have failed. [92] There is limited evidence of interventional approaches to pain management.\u00a0For refractory pain, implantable intrathecal delivery systems are an option for patients who have exhausted all other options."}

What is the frequency of pain medication? Does the patient have\u00a0any other alcohol or drug problems? Does the patient avoid activity? Is the patient depressed? Is the patient able to function?"}

The most common cause of injury is oxygen supply and demand mismatch, seen in acute myocardial infarction. [62] However, many other conditions can cause this mismatch and cause elevated troponins. For example, tachycardia can cause decreased perfusion due to reduced diastolic time when coronary blood flow occurs and oxygen demand increases. [63] Patients in shock can also have a supply and demand mismatch due to low blood volume, and elevated troponins in these patients are indicative of worse outcomes. [64]"}

Double rotation flaps are commonly used for defects too large to close with a single rotation flap. Typically, these flaps are used on the scalp or around free margins. These flaps produce a combination of both advancement and rotation, which can make categorization as either rotation or advancement flaps challenging. The design of a double rotation flap starts with a single point on the periphery of the defect, from which arcs\u00a0proceed\u00a0in opposite directions to form a semicircle with the defect at the apex of the arc (See figure). Each flap is mobilized and rotated in opposite directions to come together and close the defect. An analogy for this type of movement would be closing a book, where both sides are moving equally to meet in the middle. It is important to note that this defect is enlarged into a triangular defect, with the apex of the triangle pointing away from the apex of the semicircle, unlike the other double rotation flaps discussed below."}

The scalp is ideal for this flap because the patient\u2019s hair can provide excellent camouflage for these incisions. The flaps start at opposite ends of the defect, with both incisions taking off in the same manner, either clockwise or counterclockwise. Because the incisions are at opposite sides of the defect, the curve of the arcs is in different directions (see figure). Each flap will rotate to cover half of the lesion with minimal enlargement of the primary defect needed. In fact, the tip of each flap will need to be trimmed to inset the flaps properly. Typically, each arc is 180 degrees and rotates tissue in the same direction, meaning both flaps will either rotate in a clockwise or counterclockwise fashion.

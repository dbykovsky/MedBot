{"id": "article-43666_3", "title": "Adult Inguinal Hernia -- Etiology", "content": "Inguinal hernias can be classified as congenital or acquired. The congenital type is related to a patent processus vaginalis, an invagination of the parietal peritoneum, which precedes testicular descent through the inguinal canal during embryogenesis.

There is a recent debate that all indirect inguinal hernias result from\u00a0a processus vaginalis that had never closed. Work by Jiang and Mouravas suggests that adult indirect inguinal hernias may develop after the long-term buildup of pressure on a processus vaginalis that had closed along its entire length except at the neck of the hernia sac. [2] [3] The acquired\u00a0type of an\u00a0inguinal hernia is related to a weakening or disruption of the abdominal wall tissues due to several contributing factors, including older age, smoking, increased intraabdominal pressure such as due to a chronic cough or pregnancy, and connective tissue abnormalities. Acquired inguinal hernias are typically direct inguinal hernias where intraabdominal contents protrude through Hesselbach\u2019s triangle, medial to the inferior epigastric vessels.", "contents": "Adult Inguinal Hernia -- Etiology.

[13] In the past, patients were counseled to decrease their calcium intake to prevent hypercalciuria. However, according to research study results, dietary calcium intake decreases the risk of kidney stone formation [13] and is believed to be related to oxalate absorption through the intestinal tract. When calcium is ingested, a complex with oxalate can form, limiting both molecules\u2019 intestinal absorption. However, with dietary calcium restriction, oxalate is more freely absorbed through the intestinal tract and subsequently excreted in greater quantity by the kidneys. As more oxalate is present in the renal system, there is increased calcium-oxalate complex formation, leading to kidney stones. A 2012 study evaluated this effect among 5400 women, and showed that women with a history of kidney stones had higher levels of calcium absorption and similarly found that increasing calcium intake resulted in lower absorption levels. [13] Thiazide diuretics increase renal calcium reabsorption, remove calcium from the renal system, and can be prescribed for calcium stone prevention in the absence of primary hyperthyroidism.

Most patients who develop systemic toxicity from an FWS bite who received antivenom make a full recovery. Complications depend on the affected organ systems and may include: Rhabdomyolysis Kidney failure Cerebral edema Acute respiratory distress syndrome Respiratory failure Cardiac dysrhythmias leading to cardiac arrest Anoxic brain injury Pressure-immobilization bandage application and immediate medical intervention can prevent rapid systemic progression and the development of complications."}

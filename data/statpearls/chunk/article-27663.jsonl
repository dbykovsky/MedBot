Pharmacological Methods", "content": "Psychotropic agents Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SRIs): SRIs\u00a0have been proven to be effective in the treatment of severe mood and somatic symptoms of PMDD. The ones that have been particularly linked with the relief of symptoms are Clomipramine (a tricyclic antidepressant), [41] [42] [41] Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors like citalopram, [43] [44] escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine and sertraline, and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine. Antidepressants that predominantly affect noradrenergic transmission are not as effective for PMDD as SRIs, which means that the effect of SRIs in PMDD is not just an antidepressant effect. [45] [46] This is supported by the fact that the beneficial effect of SRIs begins rapidly in PMDD, whereas antidepressant effect takes several weeks. Thus, clinicians can use SRIs intermittently from mid-cycle to menses to treat symptoms of PMDD as opposed to continuous treatment [47] . Side effects of SRIs are usually mild. Nausea is the most common adverse effect, but it usually wears off in a couple of days after starting the therapy and doesn\u2019t reappear even if the therapy is intermittent. Reduced libido and anorgasmia are other common adverse effects, but they are absent in drug-free intervals. Benzodiazepines (BZDs): BZDs like alprazolam have been found to be effective only in women with severe anxiety and premenstrual insomnia.

The sampling port is helpful for the collection of predialysis and post-dialysis blood. A \"T\" line primes the dialyzer circuit and rinses the blood compartment toward the end of the dialysis session. There is a post-pump pressure monitor as well, and a sudden rise in it indicates impending clotting of the bloodline or dialyzer. The heparin line delivers heparin at a constant rate throughout dialysis. A venous pressure alarm is attached to the venous line; however, it may not be reliably alert to an accidental venous line detachment. Therefore a sensor is used to detect a potential line separation in those with an increased likelihood of line separation (agitated/uncooperative patients with cognitive defects). The venous air trap chamber contains any air in the bloodline, which cuts off the power supply to the pump and stops dialysis, thus ensuring patient safety. A clamp below the drip chamber along the tubing returning blood to the patient is activated by the air present in it and snaps shut, stopping the blood pump."}

Dialysis disequilibrium syndrome:\u00a0This is more common in patients during or soon after their first treatment. It is a clinical syndrome characterized by neurologic deterioration, restlessness, mental confusion, headache, occasional muscle twitching, and coma. It occurs due to a substantial gradient between the urea concentrations in the CSF and blood that causes water movement into the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in raised intracranial pressure. Patients undergoing fast dialysis develop seizures and cerebral edema more often. A reasonable goal of urea concentration reduction is 40% over two hours, URR of 0.4. Adding an osmotic agent to the blood could prevent the gradient from forming. Sodium, mannitol, high glucose dialysate, and glycerol are usually added. Setting the dialysate\u2019s sodium concentration higher throughout the treatment may be beneficial. [15] [16]"}

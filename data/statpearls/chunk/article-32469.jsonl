Sonic hedgehog (Shh) has a critical role in the development of the esophagus and other structures. Studies of Shh knock out mice show decreased rates of cell division and transcription factor expression. [18] Decreased Shh expression has also been associated with lung hypoplasia, abnormalities in smooth muscle migration, esophageal atresia, and stenosis, indicating the important regulatory roles for this protein in the development of the esophagus and suggesting important roles in human foregut defects. [2] [11] Briefly, various other factors resulting in esophageal malformations are as following: P63 knockout mice show disruption in the stratification of squamous epithelium.

Foregut malformations include a spectrum of pathologies, including tracheoesophageal fistulas with or without esophageal atresia and congenital esophageal rings.

We will begin with a description of these subtypes and then delve into management. Congenital esophageal rings can be associated with esophageal atresia and TEFs or can occur in isolation.

Type A is Isolated esophageal atresia without fistula. Type B is Esophageal atresia with the proximal TEF. Type C is esophageal atresia with a distal TEF and is the most common subtype, comprising approximately 85% of cases. Type D is esophageal atresia with both proximal and distal TEF. Lastly, type E is an isolated TEF without esophageal atresia, also known as the H-type. Because the esophagus is still continuous with the stomach, the diagnosis of type E may be delayed as issues with feeding is not readily apparent. The presence of polyhydramnios secondary to impaired swallowing of amniotic fluid may permit prenatal diagnosis. Fetal ultrasounds around 20 weeks gestation can detect esophageal atresia or TEF. [20] However, ultrasound is highly user-dependent and can be subjective. Because a prenatal diagnosis of esophageal atresia and TEF is user-dependent, undiagnosed esophageal atresia and/or TEF is common.

[1] Octreotide acts on the somatostatin receptors, which couple to phospholipase C via inhibitory G proteins, and causes vascular smooth muscle contraction. The alpha and beta-gamma subunits of the G proteins inhibit adenyl cyclase and stimulate phospholipase C, respectively. At a cellular level, like somatostatin, octreotide induces an increase in calcium entry via L-type calcium channels, which leads to increased calcium-induced calcium release via ryanodine receptor calcium release channels from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in the smooth muscle cells, thus, activating myosin light-chain kinase via its interaction with calcium-calmodulin, and therefore, initiating the contraction cycle. The release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum is also due to the formation of 1, 4,5-inositol triphosphate, potentiated by phospholipase C. [6] Hence, octreotide, similar to the action of endogenous somatostatin, inhibits the release of hormones from the anterior pituitary gland, including thyroid-stimulating hormone and growth hormone, and hormones of the gastroenteropancreatic endocrine system\u00a0such as insulin and glucagon.

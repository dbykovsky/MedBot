Knowledge of intravenous and volatile anesthetic agents for induction and maintenance, pharmacotherapy concerns of opioids and neuromuscular blocking agents, airway management, and emergency procedures is imperative when utilizing general anesthesia. Additionally, the relationship between these anesthetic agents and intraocular pressure (IOP) must be continuously evaluated. Most induction agents, including propofol, thiopental, and etomidate, decrease IOP by approximately 30%. [17] Volatile anesthetics, commonly used to maintain anesthesia after induction, also cause a decrease in IOP. The combination of propofol and sevoflurane decreases IOP significantly and is a reasonable approach to counter the increase in IOP from the sympathetic response\u00a0to laryngoscopy for airway management.

Management can consist of compressive therapy, needle aspiration, sclerodesis, limited or radical surgical irrigation, and debridement. Several case series demonstrate validity for non-operative management with compressive wrap with occasional serial aspiration. [1] [14] [15] This conservative management is reserved for asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic smaller lesions (<50 mL) with viable overlying skin. In such lesions, which fail to resolve with compression and aspiration alone, sclerodesis has been\u00a0successful in some trials using several agents, including talc, ethanol, and doxycycline. [16] [17] [18] As the lesion size increases, the probability of non-operative success decreases, and aspirating more than 50 mL of fluid was much more common among lesions that recurred (83%) than among those that resolved (33%). Therefore, it is recommended that\u00a0an internal degloving injury of more than 50 mL of fluid prompts operative intervention. [1] Shen published a literature review of 21 articles that noted superior outcomes for surgically managed lesions compared with conservative options.

[1] [2] [6] [9] [20] Hudson reported a prospective series on internal degloving injuries with an average volume of 120 mL. They used a single small incision to drain the hematoma with compression bandages post-operatively. They published good results, with only 1 of 16 patients requiring skin grafting. [2] Hak proposed a more involved surgical intervention in 1997 after doing a retrospective review of 24 Morel-Lavallee lesions. Their technique involved an incision in the middle of the degloved area, cultures of the cavity, evacuation of hematoma with aggressive irrigation, and debridement of necrotic fatty and connective tissue. The authors believed that primarily closing the incision resulted in a higher complication rate and thus proposed leaving wounds open and packed with gauze saturated in dilute Betadine for a few days before changing the dressings to saline-saturated dressings.\u00a0Nearly all their patients had associated pelvic or acetabular fractures, and the Morel-Lavallee lesion was usually debrided at the time of the orthopedic procedure. In their series, they found 46% of the patients had positive bacterial cultures at the time of debridement, with surgery performed on average 13.1 days after the injury. They reported successful healing in all wounds allowed to heal by secondary intention, with only two patients undergoing revisions for cosmetic concerns. [6] Tseng and Tornetta describe a two or three 2-cm incision technique with incisions at both the proximal and distal ends of the injury for hematoma drainage, brushing of the cavity, pulse lavage irrigation, and placement of a low-pressure drain connected to wall suction to limit reaccumulation of fluid. Over fifteen percent of the patients in their series had bacterial colonization at an average operative date of 3 days after injury, but all patients in their series had complete resolution.

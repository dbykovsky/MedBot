Staging is performed using a combination of magnetic resonance imaging and endoscopic ultrasound to characterize the lesion with computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to ensure there is no evidence of metastatic disease. Biopsy of the rectal lesion is a contentious topic as there is a risk of fragmentation and seeding of cancer. Furthermore, any disruption\u00a0to the tissue\u00a0will lead to scarring and make\u00a0mucosal resection more difficult."}

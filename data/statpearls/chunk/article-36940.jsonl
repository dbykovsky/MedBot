EMS team members are usually the first to respond to a diving-related medical emergency. If adequately equipped facilities are far from the diving site, EMS may initially transport the patient to the nearest emergency department (ED), even if the hospital lacks a hyperbaric unit. The ED physician should stabilize the patient and contact a diving physician\u2014a medical professional trained in undersea and hyperbaric medicine. Diving physicians can treat both emergent and non-urgent diving-related medical conditions."}

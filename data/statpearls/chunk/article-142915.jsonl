In cases of CI,\u00a0when an accommodative anomaly exists, there tends to be an accommodative excess. From a clinical perspective, repetition of\u00a0the NPC with +0.75 or +1.00 lenses may improve performance in pseudo-CI cases. In contrast to just AI, high plus lenses tend to increase\u00a0exophoria, thus making it more difficult for the patients to converge (while worsening symptoms). In such\u00a0cases, tailored vision therapy can be of great value."}

It is important to remember that the stylet should be within the needle every time before advancing or rotating. Immediately deep into the ligamentum flavum, there is the thecal sac with variable amounts of epidural fat; hence the needle can quickly enter the thecal sac and impress the nerve, causing shooting pain in the extremity. We ask patients to speak up if they feel radiating focal sharp pain shooting down the extremity when the needle touches the nerve root. The pain should stop immediately after withdrawing the needle by 1 mm, and CSF should flow. If the pain does not subside even after removing for a few minutes, we recommend using a different approach."}

The opening pressure of > 25 is diagnostic of idiopathic intracranial hypertension in an appropriate clinical scenario.

In patients who survive glycol ether toxicity, the long-term complications can vary widely. For example, mild kidney injury may resolve, but those who require hemodialysis generally remain dialysis-dependent. [74] [75] [76] Patients may also experience neurological complications, such as neurocognitive changes or quadriplegia, due to oxidative stress and demyelinating injury. A higher risk of developing neurological sequelae has been observed in renal failure patients. The variability of these complications is likely related to the patient's initial presentation."}

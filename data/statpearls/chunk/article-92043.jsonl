Finally, compartment syndrome is a possible postoperative complication that presents early and can be challenging to diagnose in children. Compartment syndrome should be suspected in children with increasing pain or pain that is not responsive to opioids. If a definitive diagnosis of compartment syndrome is made, then a fasciotomy will need to be performed without delay.", "contents": "Radial Neck Fracture Repair In A Child -- Complications. Radioulnar synostosis is the fusion of the radius to the ulna, which may be due to reflected periosteum. The condition can hinder pronation, supination, and result in shortening of the arm. It is more common in cases that have delayed treatment or open reduction cases in which extensive dissection has been undertaken. Osteotomy procedures can be used to treat synostosis with the aim of improving function.

[8] [9] If unsuccessful, gentle open reduction techniques can be used, but care must be taken to avoid damage to the periosteal hinge and preserve the blood supply. [10] Open reduction is associated with greater rates of loss of function, AVN, and synostosis. Additionally, not all fractures will require reduction, and conservative management is a valid treatment option for fractures that are minimally displaced.", "contents": "Radial Neck Fracture Repair In A Child -- Clinical Significance.

Following surgery, support from allied healthcare professionals, in particular physiotherapists and occupational therapists, will further enhance the patient experience. These professionals should be routinely available to deliver a therapy plan that children will be able to follow at home. The child should be encouraged to start early range of movement to avoid stiffness. Patients are usually followed up in a fracture clinic, which is conducted with support from plaster technicians and radiographs. This improves clinic flow, ensures patient safety, and enables high-quality care. Open communication with parents and thorough reviews in the fracture clinic will ensure holistic care is provided to these pediatric patients, and potential complications are flagged early.", "contents": "Radial Neck Fracture Repair In A Child -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

A systematic review of current practices is advantageous for understanding and managing ARFID; however, standardized guidelines and further research are crucial.\u00a0Moreover, the epidemiology of ARFID demonstrates significant disparities in sex and gender-related matters, distinguishing it as a distinct entity within eating disorders. Gender nuances in ARFID extend beyond mere prevalence, affecting presentation, risk factors, and treatment engagement. For example, societal expectations and gender norms may influence the acknowledgment and reporting of eating difficulties, particularly among males, who might be less inclined to seek assistance due to stigma or misconceptions about eating disorders primarily afflicting females. This gender gap underscores the importance of fostering awareness and comprehension among healthcare practitioners and the general public to ensure equal access to care for all individuals affected by ARFID, regardless of their sex or gender identity."}

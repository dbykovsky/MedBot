Subsequent progression of stenosis or a cervical disc herniation will more likely result in myelopathy at this level. Degenerative changes are usually at C5 and C6 or C6 and C7 levels due to the increased motion permitted at these levels. Additional contributors to canal narrowing are the infolding of the ligamentum flavum, spondylolisthesis, osteophytes, and facet hypertrophy.

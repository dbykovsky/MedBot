The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) arc consists of a series of brainstem nuclei and the nerves connecting them as well as the vestibular system and the extra-ocular muscles of the eye.

Both vestibular nuclei then activate or\u00a0inhibit both\u00a0abducens nuclei, which sends signals to the corresponding ipsilateral lateral rectus and contralateral oculomotor nucleus through the medial longitudinal fasciculus. The oculomotor nuclei then activate or\u00a0inhibit the corresponding ipsilateral medial recti.

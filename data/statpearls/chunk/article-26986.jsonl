Thromboembolic risk and the risk of bleeding relative to the type of surgery to be performed should be weighed in each patient treated with anticoagulants. In high thromboembolic risk cases with a low risk of surgical bleeding (e.g., skin surgery), anticoagulant therapy may not be discontinued. In surgeries with a high risk of bleeding, anticoagulant therapy should be discontinued. In these cases, if there is a patient with a high risk of thromboembolic complications, the anticoagulants should be dosed so\u00a0that the effect remains only until a few hours before surgery."}

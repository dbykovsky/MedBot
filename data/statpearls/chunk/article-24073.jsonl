Injuries can\u00a0occur\u00a0due to direct contact of the laser beam with the eye or as a result of reflection, either specular (a narrow, reflected beam) or diffuse.\u00a0The anatomy of the injury will depend on the target chromophore of the laser; several different structures may be damaged. Ablative lasers, such as\u00a0CO2 and Er:YAG lasers, target water and can, therefore, damage the cornea. Vascular and pigment lasers, such as\u00a0Nd:YAG and alexandrite lasers, target oxyhemoglobin and melanin, leading to retinal damage. To prevent ocular damage, all parties in the room should wear eye protection rated for the wavelength of the laser being used; it may be more practical for the patient to wear metal eye shields in some cases, particularly if periocular skin resurfacing is planned.

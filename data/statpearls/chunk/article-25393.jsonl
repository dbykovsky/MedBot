Tight or restrictive clothing should be removed so that the examiner can visualize the muscles being tested and observe for muscle twitch.

Muscles should first be tested with gravity eliminated by positioning the patient, so that muscle contraction is perpendicular to gravity, such as along an examining table or bed. If the patient is unable to engage the muscle with gravity eliminated, the examiner should place a hand on the muscle and ask the patient to contract his or her muscles again.

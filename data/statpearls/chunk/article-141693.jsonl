A fundamental understanding of units such as absorbed radiation dose (gray; Gy), equivalent dose (sievert; Sv), effective dose (Sv), and activity (becquerel; Bq) is essential for assessing the biological effects of radiation (see Table 1 ). On average, the typical American annually absorbs approximately 6 mSv of radiation from various sources. Approximately 50% of this exposure originates from natural background sources, including radon, while 40% can be attributed to medical radiation from diagnostic imaging and nuclear medicine procedures. The remaining 10% is due to factors such as occupational exposure, air travel, or nuclear industries. Consequently, nuclear imaging significantly contributes to public radiation levels, underscoring the importance of meticulous adherence to dose optimization policies."}

At lower doses, an increase in stochastic risks is apparent, including cancer and genetic effects, where the probability of harm linearly correlates with exposure without a strict threshold. This linear no-threshold (LNT) hypothesis postulates that even a tiny amount of radiation is harmful. The LNT hypothesis should be applied in radiation safety programs. However,\u00a0some evidence suggests that small amounts of radiation are benign and possibly associated with improved health. [14] Nevertheless, these intricate dose-response dynamics and variability within and between individuals highlight the critical need for vigilant adherence to fundamental radiation safety practices and ALARA in nuclear medicine. [15] Such practices are essential to maximize benefits while minimizing preventable harm conscientiously.", "contents": "Nuclear Medicine Safety -- Other Issues -- Radiation Effects and Their Implications.

Subsequently, the physician rotates the patient to the right down to the level of the lumbar spine segment by pulling the patient's left shoulder anteriorly until a restrictive barrier is palpated. The physician then leans the patient backward slightly to extend the lumbar spine until a restrictive barrier is palpated at the segment, engaging all 3 planes of motion to their restrictive barriers. This positioning places the patient's lumbar segment in a rotated right, side-bent right, and extended position opposite to the patient's lumbar spine diagnosis.

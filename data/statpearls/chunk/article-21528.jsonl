Midface Lift Using Resorbable Tine Prosthesis). This procedure is often performed in conjunction with an endoscopic brow lift, as the dissection required to release the midfacial soft tissues from the zygoma is an extension of the elevation needed to release the arcus marginalis around the lateral aspect of the orbital rim, which is essential for effective endoscopic brow lifting. [31] The midface lift can be performed with no additional incisions beyond those required for endoscopic brow lifting. However, some authors prefer to add a superior gingivobuccal sulcus incision to improve access to the midfacial skeleton and enhance the release and elevation of its soft tissues.

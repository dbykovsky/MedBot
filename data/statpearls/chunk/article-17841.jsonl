They play a crucial role in devising a comprehensive strategy for patient management, including determining the necessity of arterial lines, selecting appropriate monitoring techniques, and deciding on the optimal duration of catheterization. Ethics in this context involves a commitment to patient autonomy, informed consent, and considering the risks and benefits associated with arterial catheterization."}

Nurses, at the forefront of patient care, play a pivotal role in maintaining catheter patency, monitoring for complications, and ensuring patient comfort. Pharmacists contribute through medication management, especially regarding heparin infusions and preventing complications associated with medication errors. Interprofessional communication is critical, as it facilitates a seamless exchange of information and fosters a shared understanding of patient needs. Effective care coordination involves regular team meetings, clear communication channels, and a shared commitment to patient safety. Through the collaborative efforts of physicians, advanced practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals, a patient-centered approach to arterial line management is achieved, leading to improved outcomes, enhanced patient safety, and optimized team performance.", "contents": "Arterial Lines -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

Commonly employed infusate fluids include normal saline or normal saline with 1 to 2 units/mL of heparin. Studies have indicated that using heparinized solutions does not diminish the risk of catheter thrombosis. [24] Consequently, when drawing blood from the arterial line for laboratory analysis, discarding an initial portion of the blood is imperative to prevent potential laboratory errors. Typically, a waste of 1 to 3 mL suffices, the specific amount dependent on the patient's age and circulating blood volume.", "contents": "Arterial Lines -- Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions.

A point mutation is typically a change in just one base pair in a DNA molecule, and a difference of even only one nucleotide can be enough to cause significant problems in the body. [2] For example, sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder that results because of a difference in a single nucleotide in the DNA of a carrier when compared to the DNA of a non-carrier. This difference occurs in the gene that codes for one of the subunits of hemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen through the bloodstream. In this gene, there is an adenine molecule where thymine should be in the template strand of the gene, which will code for uracil instead of adenine in the corresponding mRNA, and then this altered codon will code for valine instead of glutamic acid.\u00a0The hydrophobic side chain on valine is different enough from glutamic acid that the mutation results in a conformational change, which subsequently causes hemoglobin to aggregate in low-oxygen conditions, forming hemoglobin fibers. As a result, the red blood cells that carry hemoglobin become distorted into a rigid, sickle shape these can clog small blood vessels, which is a severe condition, so one can see that even one point mutation can be disastrous for an organism.

When EMS providers arrive at the address of an emergency, they are entering an unknown situation that could be unpredictable. If a scene is considered \"safe,\" this means there are not any obvious potential threats or hazards that could impede the EMTs from doing their work or bring them harm. This could be anything from an electrical hazard to an active shooter to an agitated patient. When entering a scene, EMTs are taught priorities in a specific order: 1) personal safety, 2) safety of their partners or colleagues, and 3) care of the patient.

In patients with systemic scleroderma, the clinical assessment has two objectives: to confirm the diagnosis and to look for complications. Complementary exams to be performed if systemic scleroderma is suspected are: Nailfold capillaroscopy Screening for antinuclear antibodies (mainly\u00a0anti-centromere\u00a0and anti-scl70/anti-topoisomerase antibodies) Transthoracic echocardiography HRCT of the chest Diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and spirometry Hand X-ray Esophageal manometry When the diagnosis of systemic scleroderma is established, in addition to previous exams, it is necessary to perform: Electrocardiogram Complete blood count Renal and liver functions Urinalysis NT-pro-BNP dosage Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy Exams that should be done for follow-up each year are: NT-pro-BNP dosage Spirometry and DLCO Transthoracic echocardiography"}

The elucidation of the immunological mechanisms underpinning herpetic keratitis has predominantly utilized mouse models simulating primary corneal infection, providing valuable insights that parallel the pathogenesis observed in human herpes stromal keratitis. However, a significant distinction in the etiology of herpes stromal keratitis in humans, which typically arises from recurrent infections, often with primary infections originating from sites other than the cornea, should be noted. [15] Despite this, the immunological responses elicited by primary corneal infections in mice display dynamics and outcomes comparable to those observed in humans during the reactivation of latent virus migrating from the trigeminal ganglia to the cornea. In both scenarios, the viral presence in the cornea is effectively eliminated by 7 days postinfection (dpi). This initial phase of the infection activates corneal epithelial cells to release cytokines and chemokines, functioning as early signals that recruit various immune cells to the site of infection. This initiation of the innate immune response represents a critical step in the body's defense mechanism, setting the stage for the subsequent immune-mediated processes that characterize the progression and resolution of herpetic keratitis.

A critical examination of the cellular pathways targeted by the virus reveals potential avenues for therapeutic intervention aimed at reinforcing these host defenses. The virus circumvents the host's early warning systems, namely the TLR, RIG-I-like receptor, and cytosolic DNA sensing pathways, which are primary alerts to viral presence. HSV-1 achieves this evasion by impairing the functionality of these sensing mechanisms or their associated signaling cascades, effectively remaining under the radar of host surveillance. A notable tactic involves the viral protein ICP0, which orchestrates the ubiquitination of crucial proteins within the host's defense network, such as the interferon-gamma inducible protein 16. [55] This modification essentially cloaks the virus from the innate immune system's detection. Furthermore, HSV-1 utilizes its viral kinases to modify the phosphorylation patterns of critical transcription factors, obstructing their ability to migrate to the nucleus and activate antiviral gene expression. This manipulation is exemplified in interferon regulatory factor 3 and nuclear factor-kB pathways alteration by the viral kinase US3. Beyond these mechanisms, HSV-1 disrupts a range of essential cellular defense processes, including the presentation of antigens via MHC class I, the DNA damage response, autophagy, the endoplasmic reticulum stress response, and the process of necroptosis. Each viral evasion tactic underscores the sophisticated interplay between HSV-1 and host cellular mechanisms, highlighting critical vulnerabilities within the host's immune defense. By advancing our understanding of these interactions, a promising potential exists to develop therapeutic strategies that enhance the host's cellular responses to combat HSV-1 infection and its persistence.

This sensory loss disrupts the normal blink reflex, potentially resulting in neurotrophic keratopathy, a condition characterized by epithelial damage, increased risk of superinfection, and the possibility of corneal dissolution. Studies utilizing in vivo confocal microscopy have identified a marked reduction in sub-basal nerve plexus density in individuals with HSV keratitis compared to healthy individuals, a change that aligns with decreases in corneal sensation; interestingly, even the nonaffected eyes of those with HSV keratitis show a reduction in nerve density relative to healthy controls. [57] This decrease in corneal nerve density begins early in the infection and progresses with the disease's duration. Experimental models have shown that mice experience a loss of corneal sensation as soon as 8 days postinfection, accompanied by an increase in the expression of semaphorin 7A, a nerve guidance molecule. However, reinnervation does not restore corneal sensation functionally. The mechanisms underlying HSV-induced damage to corneal nerves are subject to ongoing debate. In a research study using mice lacking the leukocyte marker P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1, a more pronounced loss of corneal nerves was observed with fewer corneal leukocytes compared to their wild-type counterparts, suggesting viral activity rather than immune cell infiltration contributes to nerve damage.

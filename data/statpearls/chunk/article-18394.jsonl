Episodes of hyperglycemia over an extended period may lead to either diabetic ketoacidosis or a hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state.\u00a0Untreated hyperglycemia may cause the client to\u00a0enter ketoacidosis, using fatty acids for gluconeogenesis to produce the energy required for cellular function. Ketoacidosis may be due to decreased insulin production, as seen in type 1 diabetes mellitus; this clinical condition is termed diabetic ketoacidosis and is a life-threatening scenario. The lack of insulin production may result in high serum levels of ketones and ketoacids. Symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis may include fruity\u00a0breath, ketonuria, tachypnea, tachycardia, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, altered mentation, and coma."}

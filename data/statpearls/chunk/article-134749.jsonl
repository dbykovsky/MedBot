Cataract surgery technique- Cataract extraction by phacoemulsification and in-the-bag Intraocular lens implantation is preferred for the uveitic cataract due to a reduced\u00a0chance of inflammation. Phacoemulsification technique may vary depending upon the zonular status and the density of the cataract. An effort should be made to use less ultrasound power to prevent a posterior capsular tear. However, the surgical technique can be modified depending on the intraocular conditions. For eyes complicated by glaucoma, cataract surgery is not combined with trabeculectomy as the risk of bleb failure is high. Cataract extraction should be done first.

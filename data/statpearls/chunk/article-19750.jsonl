The prognosis of patients presenting with non-traumatic coma depends largely on both the etiology of coma and the level of consciousness on admission. One single-center study of patients with non-traumatic coma found a hospital mortality rate of 26.5% and accumulated two-year mortality of 43%. Mortality from poisonings was less than 15% while mortality from malignancy-related presentations was almost 90%. They found that a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 3-6 at presentation was associated with a higher hospital mortality rate than a GCS of 7-10. [4]"}

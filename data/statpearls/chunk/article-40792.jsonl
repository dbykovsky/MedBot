However, in tropical areas of the world, chigger bites can occur year-round. Patients usually display pruritic papules, sometimes clustered around tightly fitting clothes. Itching usually lasts a few days but can sometimes extend as long as 2 weeks. Lesions can sometimes form vesicles or bullae and may have surrounding violaceous macules. Treatment is usually restricted to oral antihistamines, cold compresses, and topical corticosteroids. Prevention of recurrent exposure can be achieved by completely\u00a0covering the skin or using insect repellents such as DEET and permethrin. Notable complications of chigger bites include secondary cellulitis, summer penile syndrome, and transmission of other diseases such as scrub typhus.", "contents": "Chigger Bites and Trombiculiasis -- Pearls and Other Issues.

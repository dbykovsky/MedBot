Due to the metabolic demands of growth and development, children and adolescents have higher relative energy and protein requirements than adults. [25] Children between 1 and 3 years old have the largest protein requirement in grams per kilogram because this period has the fastest growth trajectory. [34] Generally, protein requirements are estimated to be 20% to 60% greater in children and adolescents than in healthy adults. [25] Older adults are thought to require larger amounts of protein due to age-related changes in protein metabolism, such as anabolic resistance, insulin resistance, and decreased\u00a0insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels, which result in lower muscle protein synthesis and increased protein breakdown.

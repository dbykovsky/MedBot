Interestingly, several different clinical variants of porokeratosis exist, but the exact etiology and pathology of these lesions remain unclear. Of all the clinical variants, linear and giant porokeratosis have the worst prognosis, as they are most likely to undergo malignant transformation. On the other hand, malignant transformation is rare in disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis. There may be a multifactorial cause of Porokeratosis with possible etiologies, including\u00a0UV light, trauma, genetics, infectious agents, and immunosuppression.", "contents": "Porokeratosis -- Deterrence and Patient Education.

If urosepsis is present, emergent decompression should be conducted. If urosepsis is absent, the size of the stone should undergo evaluation. Observation, symptomatic treatment, alpha-blocker, and urine straining is appropriate for patients with a stone size of less than 10 mm. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy or ureteroscopy can potentially help patients with stones greater than 10 mm. [32]", "contents": "Physiology, Renal -- Clinical Significance. Nephrolithiasis is another pathology commonly seen in the renal system. Nephrolithiasis is the presence of crystallized calcium, magnesium, cystine, or uric acid in the renal system. Calcium\u00a0stones\u00a0are\u00a0known\u00a0to\u00a0cause eighty percent of nephrolithiasis. Calcium stone has two forms: calcium oxalate which is the most common and the calcium phosphate. [26] [27] Several risk factors lead to nephrolithiasis including high oxalate diet, prior history of nephrolithiasis, family history of nephrolithiasis, recurrent UTI, and enhanced enteric oxalate absorption caused by gastric bypass procedures, bariatric surgery, and short bowel syndrome. [28] [29] Approximately seventy percent of the patients with nephrolithiasis are symptoms free. [30] The most common symptoms associated with nephrolithiasis are waves of waxing and waning unilateral flank pain that lasts 20 to 60 minutes. Hematuria is also a common symptom seen in nephrolithiasis. As the diagnosis of nephrolithiasis is under consideration, other possible pathologies need to be ruled out. For instance, pyelonephritis frequently presents with flank pain, although it also presents with a fever, which is not usually present with nephrolithiasis. Ectopic pregnancy can be mistaken for renal colic. In this case, a renal and pelvic ultrasound can help to clarify.

In men, 11 to 34 percent of men older than 65 years have urinary incontinence.

Stress urinary incontinence in men is commonly known to be caused by poor urethral sphincter function. Stress urinary incontinence\u00a0is often a condition in men that underwent prostate surgery or had pelvic trauma and neurologic disorder. [34] Mixed incontinence is when both stress and urge incontinence is present. Overflow incontinence is due to detrusor contractility and/or bladder outlet obstruction. The common presentation for overflow incontinence is nocturnal enuresis due to pelvic floor relaxation that usually occurs at night in combination with a full bladder. Management of urinary incontinence usually starts with lifestyle interventions such as dietary change, weight loss, and pelvic floor muscle exercise. If these lifestyle interventions are not improving the condition, then alpha-blockers can be started. Many other drugs can be used, such as an antimuscarinic or beta-adrenergic agonist, and duloxetine.

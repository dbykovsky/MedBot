It is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) consisting of the protein scotopsin and the Vitamin A\u2013derived cofactor retinol. Light exposure allows retinol's isomerization from its 11-cis-retinal configuration into the active all-trans-retinal conformation. Isomerization of retinol into its active all-trans-retinal conformation then sets off a cascade of changes, resulting in transformation into metarhodopsin II (Meta II). Meta II activates the transducin protein, followed by the transducin alpha subunit activating cyclic guanosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase (cGMP phosphodiesterase). In the resting or dark state, cGMP directly activates cation channels that cause net depolarization of rod photoreceptors (approximately -40 mV), continuously releasing glutamate neurotransmitter that hyperpolarizes some surrounding cells and depolarizes others. In the activation or light pathway, transducin alpha subunit activation of cGMP phosphodiesterase breaks down cGMP into GMP, lowering cellular levels of cGMP and thus decreasing cation channel activity. The decreased cation channel activity causes the hyperpolarization of the rod photoreceptor and reduces the release of excitatory glutamate neurotransmitters by the rod cell. This increase in photon absorption and decreased glutamate release is a light sensation. Rod cells exhibit significant signal amplification, as each rhodopsin GPCR may activate as many as 800 transducin proteins. Reversal of rods to the resting state is mediated by arrestin, rhodopsin kinase (RK), and the closure of cGMP channels.

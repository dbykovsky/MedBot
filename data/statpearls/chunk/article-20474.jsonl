The differential diagnosis of congenital diaphragmatic hernia includes other thoracic lesions such as congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation, bronchopulmonary sequestration, bronchogenic cysts, bronchial atresia, teratomas. The appearance of intraabdominal contents within the thorax on x-ray differentiates CDH from other lesions.

Respiratory complications include chronic lung disease, home oxygen requirement, aspiration pneumonia, pulmonary hypertension, and obstructive airway disease. Gastrointestinal complications such as oral feeding aversion, gastroesophageal reflux, and growth failure are common. Neurocognitive delays, behavioral disorders, sensorineural hearing loss are also noted. Hernia recurrence is another risk that can present months to years later, especially in infants with large defects. Orthopedic deformities such as pectus, asymmetry of the chest wall, scoliosis have also been described in a significant number of infants post CDH repair.

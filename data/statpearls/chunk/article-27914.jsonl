[3] In a study of Holms and al. the eruption was thought to have developed in 90% of patients, as a consequence of damage to connective tissue within striae. [4] Therefore suggestions have been that rapid, late stretch\u00ading of abdominal skin, occurring with a high frequency in multiple pregnancies, may lead to connective tissue damage and that the exposure of antigens within collagen could elicit an allergic-type reaction, resulting in the initial appear\u00adance of the eruption in striae. Additionally, there are suggestions that peripheral chimerism (deposition of fetal DNA), which occurs particularly during the third trimester, and favors skin with increased vascularity and damaged collagen, could be subsequently the target of immune reactivity. [5] The mechanism by which lesions become generalized is also unclear. An inflammatory response is thought to be promoted by cross-reactivity to collagen in otherwise normal-appearing skin. An immune tolerance mechanism during subse\u00adquent pregnancies might prevent recurrence. [3] High levels of progesterone, especially if multiple gestations and increased progesterone receptor immunoreactivity have been demonstrated in patients with PUPPP [6] . Another hypothesis centers on fibroblast proliferation in the maternal skin, induced by a placental hormonal-type substance.

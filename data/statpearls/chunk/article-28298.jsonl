For symptomatic patients with undocumented ventricular arrhythmia, an ambulatory ECG is recommended to assess the correlation of symptoms with arrhythmia. While those patients with infrequent symptoms, implantable cardiac monitors may help in the diagnosis. [56] All patients presenting with ventricular arrhythmias should have an echocardiogram to assess cardiac structure and function, while cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is recommended in a selected group of patients to diagnose the underlying cause of ventricular arrhythmias. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging also provides information about the prognosis of patients with reentrant ventricular tachycardia. [57] An invasive electrophysiology study is no longer recommended to diagnose reentrant ventricular arrhythmias; however, it can be used for risk stratification of patients who do not meet the criteria of primary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillator.

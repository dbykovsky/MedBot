[25] Once the periapical infection spreads beyond the cortical plates of the mandible or maxilla, the bacteria can spread into other spaces as they will likely follow the path of least resistance through soft tissue. Severe infections can lead to Ludwig Angina, a\u00a0life-threatening\u00a0condition. Ludwig Angina is a deep space infection that rapidly progresses, threatens the airway and vital structures, and is characterized by the involvement of the submental space and bilateral submandibular and sublingual spaces.

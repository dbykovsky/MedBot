Some fibers of the muscle loop around the urethra and vagina in females, assuring urinary continence when contracted. Iliococcygeus muscle elevates the pelvic floor. The coccygeus muscle is the most posterior muscle of the pelvic floor, adding to the muscles of the pelvic floor function of visceral support."}

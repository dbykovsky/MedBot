Mullerian inhibiting factor, testosterone, and insulin-like factor 3, which are all produced by the testis, control male sex differentiation.

The expression of Mullerian inhibiting factor prevents the development of female internal genitalia. Without Mullerian inhibiting factor, the Mullerian duct develops into the fallopian tubes, uterus, and upper vagina. In response to the luteinizing hormone (LH), Leydig cells produce testosterone, which is responsible for the virilization of male internal genitalia, as well as the development of male secondary sex characteristics during puberty. Testosterone stabilizes the Wolffian or mesonephric duct, which differentiates into the epididymis, seminal vesicle, and vas deferens. [2] Testosterone is converted into dihydrotestosterone by 5-alpha-reductase. Dihydrotestosterone induces the differentiation of external male genitalia such as the prostate and penis.

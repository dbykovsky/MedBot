The penta-refractory disease is resistant or refractory to Anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies, bortezomib, lenalidomide, pomalidomide, and carfilzomib. This is mainly encountered in the third- or fourth-line setting. If any of these agents\u00a0have not been used before, it is reasonable to use that agent at any time. Patients with the penta-refractory disease have options of BMCA-targeted therapy (Ida-Cel, Cilta-Cel, or teclistamab); alkylator-based combination (VDT-PACE, DCEP, bendamustine); or combination regimens incorporating selinexor, venetoclax (only in cases with t(11;14) or panobinostat). Clinical trials or investigational agents are also encouraged."}

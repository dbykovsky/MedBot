The depolarization activates voltage-dependent calcium channels on the cell membrane, leading to a rise in intracellular calcium and subsequent exocytosis of insulin into the bloodstream. [7] Insulin then acts on cell membrane receptors triggering GLUT-4 expression and the movement of glucose into the cell, lowering blood glucose levels. Additionally, research has shown that glimepiride interacts with Epac3, a nucleotide exchanger that mediates the exocytosis of insulin granules.

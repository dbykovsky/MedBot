Rituximab, an anti-CD 20 monoclonal antibody, is effective in treating myositis and myositis-related interstitial lung disease. Rituximab is\u00a0preferred over\u00a0cyclophosphamide by many clinicians due\u00a0to its better tolerance and adverse effect profile. Although some patients might respond to anti-TNF agents, the studies on etanercept and infliximab have shown conflicting results.\u00a0Few cases report\u00a0tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 antibody), anakinra (anti-IL one antibody), alemtuzumab (anti-CD-52), tofacitinib, and ruxolitinib (JAK-inhibitors)\u00a0as effective agents in treating autoimmune myositis. However, no confirmatory studies exist, and these drugs\u00a0are used only in resistant cases."}

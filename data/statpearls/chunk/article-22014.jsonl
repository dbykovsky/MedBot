Chloride is a negatively charged ion and will follow into the area of positive charge. Typically, chloride will flow into the intracellular space. The addition of negative charge will decrease the resting potential of the cell, thus causing an inhibitory effect. GABAa receptors are located throughout the central nervous system.

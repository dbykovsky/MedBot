In RP, FAF reveals distinct patterns correlating with disease severity and progression. Findings from many studies found that patients with RP exhibit a ring of increased autofluorescence surrounding the fovea, indicating lipofuscin accumulation and RPE stress. This \u201cAF ring\u201d (Robson-Holder ring) corresponds to the area between the functional and nonfunctional retina border. [38] [39] [40] As RP progresses, the AF ring contracts over time, coinciding with worsening rod and cone function in the parafoveal region within the ring. [41] Once the ring reaches a critical minimum size, central vision becomes impaired. [41] The AF ring diameter also correlates with visual field sensitivity and electroretinogram amplitudes, suggesting it indicates overall retinal health. [38] [42] Beyond the AF ring, FAF reveals other patterns in RP. Atrophic patches of decreased AF, indicating RPE and photoreceptor cell death, emerge in the mid-periphery and spread centripetally. [43] The remaining areas of normal or increased FAF within atrophic zones represent \u201cislands\u201d of viable retina. [44] As RP progresses, atrophic patches coalesce while islands disappear. The location and spread of atrophic changes do not correlate well with visual function, unlike that seen in the AF ring. [38] Thus, FAF is valuable for monitoring RP progression and treatment efficacy. FAF provides insight into the complex mosaic of viable, stressed, and nonfunctional retinas seen in this condition."}

On a normal resting knee, the tibia lies approximately 0\u00a0to 2 mm anterior to femoral condyles. Any posterior tibial translation 3 mm or greater indicates a positive posterior drawer test and PCL injury. Recent studies have also found that posterior tibial translation greater than 10 mm suggests additional trauma to the PLC. The sensitivity and specificity of the posterior drawer test are reportedly 90% and 99%, respectively. [6] [12] [15]"}

Surgery should be considered immediately over non-operative management if other ligamentous structures are damaged and the knee has increased rotational instability. Surgical intervention can also be an option with PCL injuries when conservative, non-operative management has failed or there are increased osteoarthritic changes in the PCL-deficient knee present. During acute management of an isolated PCL injury, rehabilitation should focus on reducing knee joint effusion, restoring range of motion, and regaining muscle strength, especially of the quadriceps.", "contents": "Anatomy, Bony Pelvis and Lower Limb: Knee Posterior Cruciate Ligament -- Clinical Significance.

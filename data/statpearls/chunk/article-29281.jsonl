Apoptotic spermatocytes can arise in the process and are known to be frequent. Megalospermatocytes, which are very large spermatocytes, can sometimes appear. In these cells, homologous chromosomes fail to pair in a process called asynapsis, causing the cells to become abortive. Moreover, spermatogenesis can come to a halt at the stage of primary spermatocytes, stopping the morphological changes from occurring in the cells. Primary spermatocytes are seen to border the lumen of seminiferous tubules. They will not develop any further, which will lead to the disintegration of the cells and lack of spermatids production.

Therefore, genetic defects detected in motile cilia can significantly affect the formation of the sperm tail. A genetic disease called PCD (primary ciliary dyskinesia) due to the malformation of motile cilia causes pulmonary disease, increased risk of infections, and male infertility. Many genes are associated with PCD; however, the exact effect these mutated genes have on spermatogenesis is still investigational. [9]", "contents": "Histology, Spermatogenesis -- Pathophysiology.

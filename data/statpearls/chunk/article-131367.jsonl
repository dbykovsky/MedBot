A large number of women using marijuana continue its use during pregnancy. Pregnant women should be universally screened for illicit drug use, including marijuana. In addition, they should be counseled regarding potential risks of THC on maternal, fetal, and neonatal health and referred for substance use disorder treatment. Marijuana use is linked to adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Therefore, ACOG and AAP strongly recommend against the use of marijuana during pregnancy and lactation. Since marijuana is more easily available and used, there is a dire need for good quality observational and ethical studies to evaluate its effects on maternal and child health."}

These associations should be interpreted with caution due to the lack of good-quality studies. Most of the literature involves retrospective studies of mothers with a history of polysubstance abuse, relying on self-reporting and hence are subject to recall bias.

However, the harmful effects of cannabis on pregnancy and neonatal outcomes are biologically plausible, and due to the lack of sufficient safety data, the use of cannabis preconception during pregnancy and lactation is strongly discouraged.", "contents": "Marijuana and Maternal, Perinatal, and Neonatal Outcomes -- Pearls and Other Issues.

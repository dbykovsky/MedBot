They work by changing the amount of DNA coiling by adding negative supercoils or by unlinking DNA circles for prokaryotic DNA. Topoisomerase I relaxes the supercoil, and topoisomerase II adds negative supercoils. Topoisomerase is known as DNA gyrase in prokaryotes. Once the DNA strand is open, there needs to be a base for the DNA polymerase to bind and begin replication; this is provided by the primase. Primase adds short strands of RNA primers (9 to 12 pairs) onto the template to allow for DNA polymerase III or DNA polymerase alpha to bind and add nucleotides. DNA polymerase III (in prokaryotes) has 5\u2019 => 3\u2019 synthesis and 3\u2019\u00a0=>\u00a05\u2019 proofreading exonuclease.

Replication of the leading strand is simple because it is already 3\u2019\u00a0=>\u00a05\u2019 direction, the polymerase continuously adds complementary nucleotides to the primer towards the replication fork. For the lagging strand, which is 5\u2019\u00a0=>\u00a03\u2019, the new strand is synthesized in segments and discontinuously because the DNA polymerase can only read in the 3\u2019\u00a0=>\u00a05\u2019 direction. A new primer is added as the replication fork is further opened and the DNA polymerase delta builds the new DNA strand away from the replication fork, creating Okazaki fragments.

In the thoracic and lumbar spine, VP is performed using a transpedicular or parapedicular approach. [7] Using a radiolucent instrument, the incision is marked over the pedicle under fluoroscopic guidance. A small stab incision is made over the entry point, location is confirmed by AP X-ray before an incision is made. The VP hollow needle is then inserted and under AP intermittent fluoroscopic guidance the entry point is confirmed before inserting. The starting point is usually along the superior lateral edge of the pedicle with variable angulation depending on the pedicle level being accessed. [8] The medial and inferior walls of the pedicle must be clearly visualized in order to decrease injury to nerve roots and the spinal cord. [9] A mallet can be used to gently tap the device into the starting point, being careful not to cross the medial pedicle wall. If the trajectory is appropriated on the AP view, the C-arm is then transitioned to the lateral view to confirm proper pedicle placement and superior/inferior trajectory in the vertebral body. If the trajectory is appropriate, the C-arm is transitioned back to the AP view, and the VP device further advanced, being careful not to cross the medial pedicle wall. This is continued until the VP device has passed through the pedicle and is in the posterior vertebral body, which is confirmed on the lateral image. Once the posterior vertebral body has been accessed you can now advance the VP device more medial and distal with. The tip of the needle should be placed in the anterior to the middle third of the vertebral body as close to the midline as possible. [1] The final needle position should be confirmed by fluoroscopy before bone cement injection. If performing kyphoplasty, at this point the balloon catheter is then inserted and inflated using visual volume and pressure controls to create a cavity. Inflation is stopped when the pressure above 200-250 psi is obtained when the balloon contacts the cortical surface or expands beyond the border of the vertebral body, or if the height of the vertebrae is restored. The balloon is then deflated and removed. Once the cement is mixed, it is not injected until it reaches the consistency of a paste, this is done in order to prevent leakage in severely osteoporotic bone. [10] The goal is to deliver the cement at a controlled pace, and evenly in the vertebral body while avoiding extra-vertebral extravasation. Multiple AP and lateral images are utilized to confirm cement injection into the vertebral body and to confirm there is no extra-vertebral extravasation, this will appear as a radiopaque substance that is distinctly differentiated from surrounding bone. As cement is injected, the needle is slowly pulled back to allow for even distribution throughout the vertebral body.

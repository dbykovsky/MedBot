Therefore, lower frequency transducers (2.5\u00a0to 3.5 Mhz) with less attenuation should be used for deeper structures, such as renal or iliac arteries. [10] The tradeoff, however, is the lower spatial resolution with the use of lower frequency transducers. A higher frequency transducer (7\u00a0to 10 Mhz) cannot penetrate tissues as deeply but provides superior spatial resolution. [10] These transducers should be used for superficial vasculature or other superficial soft tissue structures such as finger tendons. Transducer choice for lymph nodes will depend upon their anatomic location."}

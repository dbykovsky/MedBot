Sickle cell\u00a0retinopathy can be classified as nonproliferative and proliferative. Nonproliferative sickle retinopathy (NPSR) is characterized by the presence of salmon patches, iridescent spots, and black sunbursts. Salmon patch hemorrhages are caused by sudden occlusion and rupture of a medium sized arteriole by sickled red blood cells. The hemorrhage is located between the retinal layers and the internal limiting membrane. Over time, the color changes from bright red to orange and later, yellow or white. Ultimately, the salmon patch resolves, giving rise to an area of the atrophic retina or a scar or a schisis cavity containing iridescent spots. An iridescent spot is thought to represent hemosiderin-laden macrophages that are a remnant of hemorrhage absorption. Black sunbursts are circular chorioretinal scars characterized by retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) hypertrophy which occurs either as a response to hemorrhage or choroidal neovascularization. All the previously mentioned signs are seen in the peripheral retina, but certain changes may be seen in the posterior pole including venous tortuosity, enlarged foveal avascular zone (FAZ), macular thinning, central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO), occlusion of peripapillary and perivascular arterioles.

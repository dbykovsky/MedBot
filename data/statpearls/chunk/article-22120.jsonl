The notochord is the main inductive tissue delineating neuroectoderm from the remaining ectoderm that will become skin. [22] The entire presumptive ectoderm plate expresses BMP and TGFB. Noggin and Chordin secretion from the notochord diffuses into the ectoderm directly anterior to the notochord and binds to receptors in the overlying ectoderm to block BMP. The blockade of BMP specifies the tissue to neural ectoderm, while the remaining ectoderm, which still expresses BMP, will become skin."}

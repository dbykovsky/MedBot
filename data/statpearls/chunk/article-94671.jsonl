The forceful strapping of patients against a rigid backboard is not compatible with the natural curvature of the spine, and such restriction may increase unwanted flexion, extension, and rotation. This effect is more pronounced in populations such as the elderly or those with ankylosing spondylitis who develop marked kyphosis or lordosis.

Even when moved to a cot, additional padding with towels or pillows is often required to maintain the patient\u2019s natural alignment and prevent further injury.

[4] Regarding viral hepatitis, hepatitis A and hepatitis E are frequent causes. Over 1.5 million hepatitis A infections occur worldwide, but less than 1% of them progress to ALF. Better sanitary conditions and the use of the hepatitis A vaccine has led to a decrease in the incidence of acute hepatitis A in developed countries. [5] Hepatitis B is responsible for most of the severe viral ALF cases. Hepatitis C does not appear to cause acute liver failure.\u00a0Hepatitis D infection can lead to acute liver failure in patients with hepatitis B virus co-infection.\u00a0Hepatitis E is a rare cause of ALF in the USA but represents around a 20 to 40% of ALF cases in developing countries. [6] Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is an uncommon cause of ALF. However, if untreated it carries a mortality rate of 80%.\u00a0The most commonly affected are immunocompromised and pregnant women.

Another frequent cause in patients in intensive care is ischemic hepatitis, which occurs when there is a reduction in blood flow and consequently hypoperfusion of hepatocytes leading to liver cell injury.

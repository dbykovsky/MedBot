Without Doppler imaging, distinguishing\u00a0the shared plane\u00a0of\u00a0the transversus thoracis muscle and the IMA is challenging, presenting a significant risk of catastrophic injury\u00a0(see Images . Parasternal Doppler and Ultrasound View). Consequently, the choice of surgical IMA harvest emerges as a pivotal factor in deciding the appropriate fascial plane block technique."}

Detailed knowledge of relevant anatomy is crucial for proper execution of the PIFP and decreasing the risk of pneumothorax, hematoma, and injury to the internal mammary artery. While fascial plane blocks usually cross dermatomes unilaterally, multi-level injections should be considered if local anesthetic spread is not well visualized.", "contents": "Pecto-Intercostal Fascial Plane Block -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

Significant complications to be aware of and monitored for include pneumothorax, LAST, bleeding, and infection. Nursing staff should be cognizant of LAST symptoms such as periorbital paresthesia, metallic taste, or tinnitus and skilled in monitoring for signs such as tachycardia, electrocardiography changes, hypotension, and rapid-onset seizure. If a patient requires treatment for LAST, pharmacists offer expertise in medication logistics to help the team administer the correct dosage of intralipid as quickly as possible. Monitoring is usually carried out immediately in the operating theater and is then extended to the postoperative areas (intensive care unit or postanesthesia care unit). Patient safety requires coordinated efforts across many disciplines across many locations in the hospital. Rapid and effective communication among surgeons, anesthesiologists, advanced practitioners, nursing staff, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals is necessary to limit adverse outcomes.", "contents": "Pecto-Intercostal Fascial Plane Block -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

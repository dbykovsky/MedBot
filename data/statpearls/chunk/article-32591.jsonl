Chromatin exists in one of two states: heterochromatin, which is condensed and allows little access by transcription enzymes, and euchromatin, which is loose to allow for interaction with transcription enzymes. The transition between these two states is determined by interactions between the DNA and histone proteins via post-translational modifications to the histone proteins like methylation and acetylation. [6] Methylation generally increases interactions between the DNA and histone, thus suppressing gene expression, whereas acetylation will loosen interactions resulting in greater access by transcription enzymes resulting in increased gene expression. [7] The post-translational modifications to histone proteins underlie the mechanisms of epigenetics, which are defined as alterations to gene expression without changes to the DNA sequence.

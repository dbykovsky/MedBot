For instance, in correctional facilities, the improper disclosure of protected health information can potentially result in inmates assaulting other inmates with health conditions that carry a significant social stigma. Even upon their release, these individuals can face discriminatory treatment by the general populace that hampers their reintegration into public life. While transmitting PHI\u00a0generally requires the patient's explicit consent, there are exceptions where it is transmittable without consent. For example, in a correctional facility setting,\u00a0PHI can be disclosed without consent for payment purposes, judicial proceedings. If there is a serious threat to a person's health or well-being, that can only be averted through disclosure.

Some standard procedures include data masking, encryption, and deidentification. Encryption is the equivalent of locking data in a vault and preventing anyone without the necessary digital key or certificate from accessing it. Data masking is the replacement of sensitive data values with altered values that nonetheless preserve the utility of the data set as a reference source. Encryption is more useful when attempting to protect data during transmission, while data masking is most useful when sharing data with an external organization. Deidentification is the systematic removal of eighteen pieces of identifying information,\u00a0ranging from names and telephone numbers to biometric identifiers like finger and voice prints. [8] [9] Internet communications can be secured through protocols like Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS). Wi-Fi hotspots can be secured using virtual private networks (VPN) to protect data.

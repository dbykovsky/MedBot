Targeted and often rapid reduction\u00a0of\u00a0serum IgG4 concentrations\u00a0is possible through B-cell depletion, resulting in the relative preservation of other immunoglobulins and immunoglobulin subclass\u00a0concentrations. This suggests that B-cell depletion achieves its effects, at least in part, by interfering with the repletion of short-lived plasma cells that are producing IgG4 [9] . Once these IgG4-producing cells disappear, they are not repleted following the anti-CD20 therapy because the pool of circulating B cells has been depleted. Rituximab causes an even swifter, steeper decline in blood plasmablast concentrations. Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor with cytotoxicity against plasma cells which was approved for multiple myeloma, as per reports, it was effective in IgG4-related lung and orbital disease [4] ."}

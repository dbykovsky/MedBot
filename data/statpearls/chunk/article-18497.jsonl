[37] In patients requiring shoulder surgery, this approach may be preferable in patients with significant pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, or morbid obesity. Among the supraclavicular, infraclavicular, and axillary blocks, a recent meta-analysis and systematic review found that all three have an equal likelihood of anesthetic success. [38]"}

Additionally, the nurse must frequently\u00a0auscultate lung sounds to ensure that air entry is bilateral and equal; these procedures can be associated with a pneumothorax. [39] After the procedure, a portable x-ray is recommended to ensure no pneumothorax or diaphragmatic elevation.

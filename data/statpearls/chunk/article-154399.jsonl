In CO intoxication, the pulse oximeter Sp0 2 is within normal limits, but the actual saturation of oxygenated hemoglobin is much lower. [32] Due to the high\u00a0 CO affinity to hemoglobin than oxygen (200 times more affinity), there is a much lower level of\u00a0oxyhemoglobin. In addition, CO absorbs as much light as oxyhemoglobin (0 2 Hb) at 660 nm. This means that carboxyhemoglobin can falsely elevate the Sp0 2 measurements.

When treating patients with alpha-blockers for acute retention, use a maximum dose and allow at least 72 hours before any voiding trial. (The dosage can always be reduced later.) Medications for BPH treatment typically require at least\u00a04 weeks or longer for evaluation. Five alpha-reductase inhibitors require\u00a06 months to achieve full effectiveness. Five alpha-reductase medications can be used to reduce prostatic bleeding regardless of any surgery. Before using anticholinergics or beta-agonists for overactive bladder symptoms, ensure that the urinary flow rate and\u00a0PVR are acceptable. Patients choosing less invasive therapies should be informed that such treatments often have less symptomatic improvement than more aggressive surgeries."}

Always ask your\u00a0emergency room\u00a0department to record the volume drained immediately after placing a Foley catheter for urinary retention, as this helps predict the rehabilitation time for the detrusor muscle. Do not clamp the Foley catheter or restrict drainage when a residual urine volume of 1500 mL or more is drained. Allow it to drain freely. Be aware of the possibility of postobstructive diuresis. If no option is available other than long-term catheter drainage, a suprapubic tube is generally preferred over a urethral Foley for patient comfort and reduced complications.", "contents": "Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia -- Pearls and Other Issues.

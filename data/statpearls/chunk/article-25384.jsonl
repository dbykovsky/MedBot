{"id": "article-25384_40", "title": "Muscle Cramps -- Differential Diagnosis", "content": "A cramp is a painful contraction of a short duration and can be distinguished from other muscle contractions. Dystonia is\u00a0a non-painful contraction\u00a0of central origin, and myotonia is a protracted non-painful contraction as in the case of myotonic dystrophy and dystrophy of Thomsen. Tetany can be painful but seldom involves only one muscle area, like Camurati-Engelmann disease, anorexia nervosa (Russell sign), or in case of hypocalcemia. Myalgias are muscular pains not necessarily\u00a0accompanied by contraction for several reasons, such as vitamin D hypovitaminosis, drug abuse, or spastic hypertonia following central nervous lesions. Muscle pain in the lower limbs during walking or\u00a0intermittent\u00a0claudication is a symptom of peripheral vascular stenosis. In these cases, the cramp could appear if the patient continues to walk. The syndrome of the legs without rest are involuntary contractions of the lower limbs which do not cause cramps, but only soreness and muscular tiredness when the contractile activity ceases. Similar contractions\u00a0also\u00a0could\u00a0be symptoms of Parkinsonism.", "contents": "Muscle Cramps -- Differential Diagnosis.

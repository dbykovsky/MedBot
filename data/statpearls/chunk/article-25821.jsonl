Any neuron will have on average of 1000 synapses which influence the electrical potential of the membrane. When the resting membrane potential (-60mV) becomes less negative, it depolarizes. When it is more negative, it hyperpolarizes. Upon collating the various movements of ions, particularly the entering of sodium, the cell may have sufficient signals to reach\u00a0the threshold potential and achieves this threshold by sufficient positively charged ions entering the cell, i.e., terminating the polarity in what is called depolarization. At normal body temperature, the equilibrium potential for sodium is +55 mV, -103 mV for potassium. There are three stages in the generation of the action potential: (1) depolarization, changing the membrane\u2019s potential from -60 mV to +40 mV primarily caused by sodium influx; (2) repolarization, a return to the membrane\u2019s resting potential, primarily caused by potassium efflux; and (3) after-hyperpolarization, a recovery from a slight overshoot of the repolarization. [3] (see table below)\u00a0 As mentioned, stage 1 is guided by an increased membrane permeability to sodium. Accordingly, the removal of extracellular sodium, or inactivation of sodium channels, prevents the generation of action potentials. [4] Immediately after an action potential generates, the neuron cannot immediately generate another action potential; this is the absolute refractory period. At this moment, the sodium channels are inactivated and remain closed, whereas the potassium channels are still open. This state is followed by the relative refractory period when the neuron may only generate an action potential with a much higher threshold. Thie opens when some of the sodium channels are ready to be opened, and many are still inactivated, whereas some potassium channels are still open as well. The duration of the refractory periods will determine how fast an action potential may be generated and propagated. The propagation of the action potential continues until termination at a synapse, where it can either cause the release of neurotransmitters or conduction of ionic currents. The latter occurs at electrical synapses, whereby presynaptic and postsynaptic cells connect and avoid the use of neurotransmitters.

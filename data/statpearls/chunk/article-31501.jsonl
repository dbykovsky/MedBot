Bupivacaine has a long history of safe use, a low incidence of transient neurologic symptoms (post-spinal temporary radiating pain down the buttock and thighs), and it produces a reliable block.

[40] Spinal chloroprocaine is an intriguing alternative to bupivacaine for short procedures (less than 60 minutes). The incidence of transient neurologic symptoms with spinal chloroprocaine is less than spinal lidocaine and equivalent to spinal bupivacaine.

Surgical management: surgery is indicated in those patients who fail to respond to medical and laser therapies. It may also be indicated in those patients who may be expected to have further exposure to steroids. The most commonly employed surgical procedure is trabeculectomy;\u00a0other options include deep sclerectomy,\u00a0canaloplasty,\u00a0tube shunt surgeries,\u00a0or cyclophotocoagulation procedures.

The process of the buildup of cerumen or other debris is what leads to symptoms of otalgia, otorrhea, and water trapping. While often associated with debris or cerumen, these symptoms can be caused by the exostoses themselves if they are occluding a significant portion of the auditory canal.

The degree of hearing loss is relative to the degree of ear canal occlusion, which is predominantly determined by the size of exostoses.

CAI theoretically results from the impairments from proprioceptive deficits and increased ligamentous laxity secondary to recurrent ankle sprains. [2] As a result of CAI, normal ankle joint function can be impaired, affecting everyday activities, such as walking or occupational involvement. Patients who develop CAI typically have an extensive history of recurrent ankle sprains and severe inversion injury.", "contents": "Recurrent Ankle Sprain -- Complications.

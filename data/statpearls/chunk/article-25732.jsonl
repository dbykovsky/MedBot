The supraorbital nerve is one of the terminal branches of the trigeminal nerve. The trigeminal nerve divides into three branches: the ophthalmic nerve (V1), the maxillary nerve (V2), and the mandibular nerve (V3). [2] The\u00a0supraorbital nerve is a branch of the ophthalmic nerve. This sensory nerve branches into two separate terminal branches, known as the smaller supratrochlear nerve and the larger supraorbital nerve. The supraorbital nerve exits the cranium through an opening above the orbit known as the supraorbital notch or supraorbital foramen which lies within the medial one-third of the supraorbital margin, 2 to 3\u2009cm lateral to the midline. The nerve then ascends the forehead and\u00a0terminates at the region of the anterior scalp, thus providing sensory input for tissues up to the region of the lambdoidal suture (connection of the parietal and occipital bones). The supratrochlear nerve provides sensory information in a small area that is close to the midline. The supraorbital foramen can be visually identified by having the patient look straight ahead and then transect the pupil at the level of the patient\u2019s orbital ridge. Palpation of this region reveals the area of interest for performing this nerve block. [3] [4] [5] A majority of supraorbital nerve exits existed as notches (73.8%) and the rest as foramina (26.2%). [6] Accessory exits were seen in 18.9% of skulls. Of the skulls examined, 55.1% displayed bilateral supraorbital notches, 8.6% had bilateral supraorbital foramina, and 36.3% had a notch on one side and a foramen on the contralateral side.

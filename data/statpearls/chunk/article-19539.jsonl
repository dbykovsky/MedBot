Converting from CNI to an mTOR inhibitor showed improvement in kidney function, which was more observed with the conversion from cyclosporine compared to tacrolimus. [27] Conversion to an mTOR inhibitor was also associated with a lower risk of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. [27] Conversion to sirolimus showed better outcomes in patients with GFR exceeding 40 ml/min with less proteinuria, suggesting that conversion should occur before significant parenchymal damage. [28] Grimbert et al. suggested that early conversion to mTOR inhibitors within one year was associated with increased production of dnDSA, which increased the risk of antibody-mediated rejection. Therefore, conversion to mTOR inhibitor therapy with the elimination of CNI therapy should be performed with great caution and may increase the risk of CKTR.

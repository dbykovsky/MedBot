Clinicians need to be aware that besides seizures, these lesions can present with psychiatric symptoms in the form of rage behaviors, mood disorders, and aggression. [7] There is a general lack of clinical data on such significant comorbidity. Risk factors for psychiatric comorbidity in patients with hypothalamic hamartoma are unknown. Predictors for the increased possibility of aggression are male gender, intellectual disability, early age at the onset of seizure activity, and multiple seizures instead of only gelastic seizures. Atypical presentations of mood or psychiatric symptoms should call for imaging studies of the brain.", "contents": "Aggression in Hypothalamic Hamartoma -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

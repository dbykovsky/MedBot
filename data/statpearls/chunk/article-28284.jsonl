Solely performing a cystoscopy\u00a0to diagnose recurrent UTIs is rarely indicated, as\u00a0this might induce an ascending lower UTI. [22] [23] Cystoscopy is rarely helpful when utilized routinely; however, the modality can be\u00a0useful\u00a0in post-operative exclusion and management of possible ureteral injuries, evaluating incomplete bladder emptying, or identifying possible bladder calculi. The optimal recommended type of irrigation fluid\u00a0utilized during cystoscopy has\u00a0been investigated.

Treatment is supportive.\u00a0One retrospective study utilizing National Poison Data System data aimed to characterize poisoning exposures to skeletal muscle relaxants in pediatric and adolescent populations. From 2010 to 2020, a study identified 2605 cases of single-agent exposures to carisoprodol, meprobamate, methocarbamol, or metaxalone in patients aged 6 to 19. Findings revealed that the majority of cases (75.74%) were intentional exposures, with suicide attempts accounting for over half of these incidents. Clinical effects commonly observed included drowsiness, tachycardia, vomiting, and slurred speech. Most exposures (81.04%) resulted in referral or management at healthcare facilities, with intravenous fluids and activated charcoal commonly administered interventions. The study underscores the importance of understanding skeletal muscle relaxant toxicity in adolescents to inform effective management strategies.

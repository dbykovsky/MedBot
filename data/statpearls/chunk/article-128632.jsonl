Bone scans can be used to evaluate multifocal disease. However, this is being replaced nowadays with FDG PET-CT scans for staging and restaging assessments. Although whole-body MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is the mainstay of imaging, it may have some limitations at follow-up with prostheses artifacts and assessing response to treatment. A CT scan with thin slices is required to monitor for any lung metastasis. FDG PET-CT is very good at initial staging, restaging, therapy response assessments, and reports showing sensitivity and specificity in the '90s. One should pay close attention to the PET-CT protocol used and adjust the attenuation correction CT protocol to be able to detect small lung nodule metastasis. This is crucial considering the lung is the site of 80% of metastasis. [24] [25] [26] Quantitative parameters such as metabolic tumor volume and total lesion glycolysis may be best used to assess response to treatment. [27] FDG PET\u00a0at 6 weeks\u00a0can predict neoadjuvant chemotherapy effect on time to progression and pathologic response. FDG PET was also described to be of prognostic value. [28] [24] [29] [30] [31] [24] The Children's oncology group recommends FDG PET and or SPECT Bone scanning at initial diagnosis and before any surgery or local control intervention.

Sarcomas: Bone sarcomas account for approximately 6 percent of all childhood cancers, and osteosarcomas account for approximately 3 percent of childhood cancers overall. Bone scans can be used to evaluate multifocal disease. However, this is being replaced nowadays with FDG PET-CT scans for staging and restaging assessments. Although whole-body MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is the mainstay of imaging, it may have some limitations at follow-up with prostheses artifacts and assessing response to treatment. A CT scan with thin slices is required to monitor for any lung metastasis. FDG PET-CT is very good at initial staging, restaging, therapy response assessments, and reports showing sensitivity and specificity in the '90s. One should pay close attention to the PET-CT protocol used and adjust the attenuation correction CT protocol to be able to detect small lung nodule metastasis. This is crucial considering the lung is the site of 80% of metastasis. [24] [25] [26] Quantitative parameters such as metabolic tumor volume and total lesion glycolysis may be best used to assess response to treatment.

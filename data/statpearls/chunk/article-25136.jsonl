The critical difference between gastroschisis and omphalocele is that an omphalocele is herniated bowel covered by the amnion. In contrast, in gastroschisis, the viscera are not covered and have direct exposure to amniotic fluid. Omphalocele is due to an abdominal wall defect. In comparison, gastroschisis is thought to be due to herniated bowel not being able to return to the abdominal cavity correctly. [23] A congenital umbilical hernia can arise when the umbilical ring fails to close following the herniation of the midgut.", "contents": "Embryology, Midgut -- Pathophysiology.

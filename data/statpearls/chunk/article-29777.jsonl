Patch testing like the American Contact Dermatitis Society Core allergen series, the North American Contact Dermatitis Group patch test, and the thin-layer, rapid-use (TRUE) test are vital tools for recognizing the offending agent. None of the patch series screens for allergy to 2-octyl cyanoacrylate found in topical skin adhesives. In cases where such patches are unavailable, it has been suggested to consider testing with a\u00a0suture through the skin versus placing the offending agent against the skin. A stand-alone, cutaneous test is recommended for suspected topical skin adhesives allergies. [2]"}

Amongst the complications are the following: postoperative adhesions, wound dehiscence, infection, and intestinal obstruction along the line of suture material to which the patient had been sensitized during a previous surgery. Suture materials increase the potential of bacterial colonization with low virulence in their sites and may lead to infections like Staphylococcus epidermidis infection.

MOGAD has a lower female-to-male ratio or male predominance and is noted more often in childhood. Clinical presentations may\u00a0include features similar to acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), optic neuritis, myelitis, and brainstem encephalitis. MRI features include bilateral anterior involvement of the optic nerve with long length, and the optic chiasma is less involved. The optic nerve head is usually swollen. In the spinal cord, a long segment of the conus or thoracolumbar spinal cord is usually affected. Contrast enhancement is infrequent. In the brain, MRI features include deep gray matter lesions, large lesions similar to ADEM, and\u00a0fluffy lesions in\u00a0cerebellar peduncles, pons, and around the fourth ventricle.\u00a0Lesions\u00a0of the peri-ependymal areas are rare. Up to 50% of patients with NMOSD or MOGAD can have a normal brain MRI at presentation. [39]"}

[38] Subsequently, two large multicenter randomized trials have provided important comparative data for DCB use over both first and second-generation DES. The ISAR-DESIRE 3 (Efficacy Study of Paclitaxel-Eluting Balloon, Stent vs. Plain Angioplasty for Drug-Eluting Stent Restenosis) trial compared DCB therapy to both 1st generation DES and POBA. The results of the study revealed that DCB application was non-inferior to DES placement, and both were superior to POBA. [39] Perhaps the more clinically relevant study is the Restenosis Intra-stent of Drug-eluting Stents: Paclitaxel-Eluting Balloon vs. Everolimus-Eluting Stent (RIBS-IV) trial, [40] which compared second-generation everolimus-eluting stents to DCB angioplasty for treatment of DES-ISR. Second-generation DES showed better angiographic and clinical outcomes than DCB, thereby suggesting that in situations where there is no clear contraindication to repeat stenting, DES strategy may be the preferred option.

Furthermore, unlike the traditional DES architecture, the bioabsorbable nature of the scaffold avoids permanent deposition of an additional layer of stent strut, potentially reducing the risk of restenosis.

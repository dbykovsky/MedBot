Current recommendations recommend that troponin testing be available in all hospitals 24/7 with a turnaround time of 30 to 60 minutes. [47] In addition to its application as a diagnostic marker for myocardial infarction, elevated levels of troponin also have prognostic significance; high levels suggest an elevated risk for adverse cardiac events. Further, data show that increasing levels of troponin and creatinine are strong predictors of worsening congestive heart failure. [48]"}

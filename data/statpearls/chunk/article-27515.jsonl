Neonates with posterior urethral valves typically present with a triad of symptoms: 1) urinary retention, 2) palpable bladder, and 3) respiratory distress due to oligohydramnios and Potter sequence. Failure of a newborn to void within the first 24 hours after birth is a \"red flag\" for possible posterior urethral valves and other significant abnormalities. Diagnosis is usually suspected prenatally based on ultrasound findings showing bilateral hydronephrosis, dilated posterior urethra, and a distended bladder. Ultrasonography should be used to evaluate suspected posterior urethral valves. Confirmatory imaging is done with a VCUG or direct visualization via cystoscopy.", "contents": "Posterior Urethral Valves -- Pearls and Other Issues. Key facts to keep in mind about posterior urethral valves include the following: Posterior urethral valves are the most common cause of lower urinary tract obstruction in male neonates, occurring in approximately 1 in 5,000 to 1 in 8,000 live births. Neonates with posterior urethral valves typically present with a triad of symptoms: 1) urinary retention, 2) palpable bladder, and 3) respiratory distress due to oligohydramnios and Potter sequence. Failure of a newborn to void within the first 24 hours after birth is a \"red flag\" for possible posterior urethral valves and other significant abnormalities. Diagnosis is usually suspected prenatally based on ultrasound findings showing bilateral hydronephrosis, dilated posterior urethra, and a distended bladder. Ultrasonography should be used to evaluate suspected posterior urethral valves. Confirmatory imaging is done with a VCUG or direct visualization via cystoscopy."}

Nonurological symptoms would include unexplained lethargy, fatigue, poor eating, or failure to thrive. Complications of posterior urethral valves include renal impairment, hydronephrosis, vesicoureteral reflux, urinary tract infections, and bladder dysfunction. Definitive treatment involves endoscopic ablation of the valves via cystoscopy. This procedure aims to relieve the obstruction and prevent long-term renal damage. In severe cases, vesicostomy or urinary diversion may be necessary. Early postoperative urodynamic studies are crucial for optimizing bladder health, minimizing additional detrusor damage, and maximizing renal function following surgical ablation of posterior urethral valves.

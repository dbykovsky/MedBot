Besides lowering LDL levels, controlling the patient\u2019s lifestyle risk, and other modifiable risk factors of coronary heart disease is essential in reducing CV morbidity and mortality in these patients. Setting a suitable target LDL level is difficult, as patients with FH present with varying degrees of elevated LDL levels. Most guidelines recommend a reduction of 50% or more\u00a0from the initial untreated LDL level in patients with FH. [30] [31] Some guidelines consider patients with prior coronary heart disease or concomitant diabetes are considered high risk, and\u00a0the recommendation is to have an LDL level below 70 mg/dL, while patients without prior coronary heart disease or diabetes are considered the low-moderate risk and have recommended target LDL level below 100 mg/dL. LDL levels should be checked every 2 to 3 months while on treatment to adjust drug therapies accordingly. [32]"}
{"id": "article-23166_25", "title": "Familial Hypercholesterolemia -- Treatment / Management -- Drug Therapies", "content": "Statins are the standard therapy for familial hypercholesterolemia. All guidelines recommend statins as first-line drugs for patients with FH, with a goal of reaching maximally tolerated doses. [33] The effect of statins has been well studied, and most randomized clinical trials observed a reduction of around 50 percent of the initial untreated LDL levels, as well as a reduction in cardiovascular events. [34] [35] [36] Unfortunately, a large number of patients with FH, even on maximally-tolerated statins alone, either do not show this level of reduction in LDL levels, or they do not reach their goal LDL levels, even with a 50 percent reduction, because their initial LDL levels are so high. [35] Second-line therapies include ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors. Ezetimibe has been showing to add an extra 10 to 30 percent reduction in LDL levels for patients on maximally tolerated statins. [37] [38] Currently, ezetimibe is the drug of choice as the second line in most guidelines. [39] PCSK9 inhibitors have shown a great reduction in LDL levels and cardiovascular outcomes in different randomized clinical trials. [22] [40] In those trials, PCKS9 inhibitors lowered LDL levels by 50 to 60 percent. While exhibiting higher efficacy than ezetimibe, the use of PCSK9 inhibitors is limited by their high cost and the reluctance of insurance companies to approve their use. [41] Hence, PCSK9 inhibitors can be used as second or third-line drugs for patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.

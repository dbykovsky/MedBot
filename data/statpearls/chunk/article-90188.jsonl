ATACH study observed a nonsignificant relationship between the magnitude of systolic blood pressure (SBP) reduction and hematoma expansion and 3-month outcome. [24] But the INTERACT study showed that early intensive BP-lowering treatment attenuated hematoma growth over 72 hours. [25] It has been found that high SBP is associated with neurological deterioration and death. [20] The American Stroke Association (ASA) recommendation is that for patients presenting with SBP between 150 and 220 mmHg, the acute lowering of SBP to 140 mmHg is safe\u00a0and can improve functional outcomes. For patients presenting with SBP >220 mmHg, an aggressive reduction of BP with a continuous intravenous infusion\u00a0is needed."}

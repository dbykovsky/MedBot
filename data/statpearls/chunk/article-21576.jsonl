This function is determined by which enzymes are present that can modify factor V. Factor V gets modified by activated factor X, thrombin, and activated protein C (aPC). Factor V plays a part in the common pathway of the coagulation cascade. In the coagulation cascade, factor V forms a prothrombinase complex with factor X. This prothrombinase complex aids in developing a fibrin and platelet clot and helps to stop bleeding. [1] [2] The coagulation cascade consists of an intrinsic, extrinsic, and common pathway. The cascade involves the activation of clotting factors through the action of serine proteases. Some of these factors will bind to form complexes that can then act as proteases, usually, a serine protease which activates more clotting factors downstream.

Rodondi et al studied 55,000 patients in a prospective cohort study and found that a TSH between 10.0\u00a0and 19.9\u00a0mIU/L correlated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease events (hazard ratio of 1.86;\u00a0CI 1.28-2.80) and cardiovascular mortality (Hazard ratio of 1.58; CI 1.10-2.27). [51] However, Gusekloo et al showed that in older individuals (aged 85 or older), higher TSH levels\u00a0were associated with a reduced mortality rate. [52] Rodondi et al studied 2730 individuals between the ages of 70 and 79 over a 4-year follow-up period and found a higher risk of congestive heart failure with TSH levels of 7.0 mIU/L or higher. [53] Adrees et al showed that the increased levels of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP), total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL-cholesterol, lipoprotein(a), homocysteine, and carotid intima-media thickness were associated with subclinical hypothyroidism in 54 women, which normalized after 18 months of levothyroxine treatment and became similar to euthyroid women.

It provides a nonnegotiable ethical standard and is an expression of nursing\u2019s own understanding of its commitment to society. The Code of Ethics has been revised\u00a0over time. The current version represents advances in technology, societal changes, expansion of nursing practice into advanced practice roles, research, education, health policy, and administration, and builds and maintains healthy work environments.

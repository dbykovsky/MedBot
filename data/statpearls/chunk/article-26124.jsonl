Patients suspected or confirmed to have ocular melanoma typically commence their evaluation with an ophthalmologist specializing in ocular oncology. Furthermore, essential consultations include an ocular oncologist, a radiation oncologist, and an occupational therapist.

Risk factors for ocular melanoma include fair skin, light-colored eyes, and older age. The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends a dilated eye examination by age 40 for early detection. Additional risk factors include dysplastic nevus syndrome, a family history of ocular melanoma, eye freckles, nevus of Ota, germline mutation in the BAP1 gene, and occupational exposure to arc welding. Cancer screening is advised for asymptomatic individuals to facilitate early detection and successful treatment. Individuals\u00a0with predisposing conditions may benefit from annual ophthalmologic examinations. Limiting sunlight exposure could prevent intraocular melanoma in susceptible individuals.", "contents": "Ocular Melanoma -- Deterrence and Patient Education.

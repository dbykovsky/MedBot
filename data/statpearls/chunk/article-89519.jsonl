{"id": "article-89519_13", "title": "EMS Pain Assessment And Management -- Issues of Concern -- Pain Management", "content": "Non-opiate pain medication is considered one of the first-line treatment options for acute pain for non-healthcare individuals. The (2) primary classes include aniline analgesics and non-steroid anti-inflammatories. The primary mechanism of action for both NSAIDs and acetaminophen (which is a non-opiate analgesic) is by the reduction of prostaglandins in the brain by reducing cyclooxygenase (COX inhibitors). Additional non-opiate analgesic medications include nitroglycerin. Aniline analgesics are a class of medications first produced in 1886, with acetanilide being the first drug of this class with its major metabolite being paracetamol, but its use was stopped because of cyanosis due to methemoglobinemia. Phenacetin (synthesized by Bayer in 1887) and paracetamol (synthesized at Johns Hopkins University in 1887) are additional aniline derivatives. Phenacetin gained faster acceptance over paracetamol because the original thinking was that paracetamol to produced methemoglobinemia, but in the 1940s, research disproved this and determined that phenacetin metabolized to paracetamol. In the 1980s, phenacetin was banned secondary to hematological toxicity, analgesic nephropathy, and abuse due to psychotropic effects. Acetaminophen (para-acetylaminophenol or NPAP) First created in 1887 and has been one of the most commonly used pain and fever-reducing medications in the Americas and Europe. It has been listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as an essential medication and is deemed safe in pregnancy. It has many medical uses, including fever reduction, mild to moderate pain management, and has been combined with opioids to improve analgesic effects. Adverse effects include liver damage (either in acute overdoses or with chronic use) via the toxic intermediate product NAPQI (N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine) and recent FDA warning about rare development of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Mechanism of action is with COX-2 inhibition and within the hypothalamus to produce antipyresis. Para-acetylaminophenol breaks down into three separate metabolites via different processes that include: (1) glucuronidation, (2) sulfation, and (3) N-hydroxylation by cytochrome P-450.\u00a0 NAPQI is the toxic metabolite produced during the N-hydroxylation process and reacts to sulfhydryl groups of glutathione to produce harmless metabolites.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) break down into either COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitors, with both isozymes having a similar mechanism of action of inhibiting the breakdown of arachidonic acid with downstream reduction of prostaglandins, thromboxane, and prostacyclin. [24] This class of medication, when not contraindicated, can be used separately as being favored over acetaminophen (paracetamol) due to the anti-inflammatory properties or in conjunction with acetaminophen (paracetamol) with synergistic effects.

The first described use for nitroglycerin in medicine dates back to 1867, when Lauder Brunton treated patients with angina. Today nitroglycerin is on the World Health Organization's list of essential medications. [26] Nitroglycerin causes smooth muscle dilation by decreasing the cytosolic calcium levels. This process occurs through the release of nitrous oxide that stimulates the conversion of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which acts as a cellular messenger. cGMP stimulates protein kinase P, a second messenger that causes a drop in the cytosolic calcium and smooth muscle dilation.

Non-opiate pain medication is considered one of the first-line treatment options for acute pain for non-healthcare individuals. The (2) primary classes include aniline analgesics and non-steroid anti-inflammatories. The primary mechanism of action for both NSAIDs and acetaminophen (which is a non-opiate analgesic) is by the reduction of prostaglandins in the brain by reducing cyclooxygenase (COX inhibitors). Additional non-opiate analgesic medications include nitroglycerin. Aniline analgesics are a class of medications first produced in 1886, with acetanilide being the first drug of this class with its major metabolite being paracetamol, but its use was stopped because of cyanosis due to methemoglobinemia. Phenacetin (synthesized by Bayer in 1887) and paracetamol (synthesized at Johns Hopkins University in 1887) are additional aniline derivatives. Phenacetin gained faster acceptance over paracetamol because the original thinking was that paracetamol to produced methemoglobinemia, but in the 1940s, research disproved this and determined that phenacetin metabolized to paracetamol. In the 1980s, phenacetin was banned secondary to hematological toxicity, analgesic nephropathy, and abuse due to psychotropic effects. Acetaminophen (para-acetylaminophenol or NPAP) First created in 1887 and has been one of the most commonly used pain and fever-reducing medications in the Americas and Europe. It has been listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as an essential medication and is deemed safe in pregnancy. It has many medical uses, including fever reduction, mild to moderate pain management, and has been combined with opioids to improve analgesic effects. Adverse effects include liver damage (either in acute overdoses or with chronic use) via the toxic intermediate product NAPQI (N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine) and recent FDA warning about rare development of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Mechanism of action is with COX-2 inhibition and within the hypothalamus to produce antipyresis. Para-acetylaminophenol breaks down into three separate metabolites via different processes that include: (1) glucuronidation, (2) sulfation, and (3) N-hydroxylation by cytochrome P-450.\u00a0 NAPQI is the toxic metabolite produced during the N-hydroxylation process and reacts to sulfhydryl groups of glutathione to produce harmless metabolites.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) break down into either COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitors, with both isozymes having a similar mechanism of action of inhibiting the breakdown of arachidonic acid with downstream reduction of prostaglandins, thromboxane, and prostacyclin.

NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor antagonists are a group of medications that can induce a state of dissociation and, therefore, can produce anesthesia characterized by loss of short-term memory (amnesia), inability to feel pain (analgesia), and decreased sensitivity to pain (catalepsy). The primary role is to inhibit the action of glutamate, which is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter of the brain and spinal cord. These medications have been used to treat acute and chronic pain syndromes."}

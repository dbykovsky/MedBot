No single or combined therapy in unresectable, locally advanced, and metastatic cholangiocarcinoma will achieve a cure; rather the focus is on palliative intervention and extension of survival. All patients with advanced and\u00a0unresectable disease should be\u00a0offered a clinical trial when feasible. Patients with good performance status (ECOG 0-1) for chemotherapy could consider first-line option Gem [1000 mg/m2] plus Cisplatin (Cis) [25 mg/m2] on days one and eight every three weeks with acceptable toxicity in low dose cis as published in ABC-02 randomized phase 2 study which included 242 metastatic bile duct cancer patients and showed a mOS of 11.7 months in the combination arm when compared to 8.3 months of Gem alone (HR, 0.70; p0.002).\u00a0Other\u00a0first-line, gem-based combinations are not\u00a0randomized studies and have reported a mOS for GemCap\u00a012.7 months and Gem with\u00a0Oxaliplatin\u00a014.3 months both on a selected population of patients. Alternative 5-FU-based combination plus Cis 11.5 months or\u00a0Cap\u00a011.3 months. Patients with poor performance may receive oral\u00a0Cap which reported a mOS of 8.1 months when compared to the best\u00a0supportive care of 4.5 months. Future clinical trials with targeted therapy, including FGFR, MEK, and other drugs tailored per the tumor molecular profile, are ongoing and preliminary reports are promising. [14] [15]"}

Therefore, further studies are needed to determine the etiology, including blood work, CSF evaluation, and radiological evaluation of the entire trigeminal nerve pathway. The first treatment of choice for TNO pain includes tricyclic anti-depressants (TCAs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), or gabapentinoids (gabapentin, pregabalin). Even if the initial work-up does not reveal a causative agent, neurologic follow-up is required because TNO can be an initial symptom of underlying neoplastic or autoimmune disease.", "contents": "Trigeminal Neuropathy -- Pearls and Other Issues.

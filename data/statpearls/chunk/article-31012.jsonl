The gradient in pressure creates a conversion of potential to kinetic energy, which is flow. The change in P between two points in the circulation is determined by the R between them and the F, delta P = FxR.

Second, R also depends on the number of vessels in parallel, where parallel circuits confer lower R (relative to circuits in series). Therefore, this explains why the aggregated R is highest in the arterioles, as while a capillary has higher individual R than an individual arteriole, capillaries exist far more than arterioles. [8] Within the microcirculation, the precapillary R and postcapillary R determine capillary P, which influences the movement of fluid between the capillaries and the interstitial fluid. Normally, the postcapillary R is lower than the precapillary R, but in cases of arteriolar constriction or venular dilation, an increase in the magnitude of this difference occurs dropping capillary hydrostatic pressure and decreasing the driving force for movement of fluid out of the capillaries.

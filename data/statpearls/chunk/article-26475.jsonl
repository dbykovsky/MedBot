Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) is\u00a0a\u00a0gonadotropin synthesized and secreted from the anterior pituitary gland in response to slow-frequency pulsatile GnRH. FSH stimulates the growth and maturation of immature oocytes into mature (Graafian) secondary follicles before ovulation.\u00a0FSH Receptors are G-protein coupled receptors and are found in the Granulosa cells that surround developing ovarian follicles.

After 2 days of sustained elevation of estrogen levels, the LH surge causes luteinization of the granulosa cells into LH receptive cells. This transition enables granulosa cells to respond to LH levels and produce progesterone.

Estrogen is produced by the granulosa cells of the developing follicle and exerts negative feedback on LH production in the early part of the menstrual cycle.

The most common cause of chronic ovulatory dysfunction in the United States is polycystic ovarian syndrome, or PCOS, which interferes with ovulation at multiple points. [3] Polycystic ovarian syndrome is considered an endocrinopathy that is the etiology for anovulatory infertility (ie, >90% of cases). PCOS is characterized by irregular menstrual cycles secondary to anovulatory bleeding caused by friable hyperplastic endometrial tissue and hyperandrogenism, and it is associated with various metabolic derangements (i.e., hyperinsulinemia). [12] It is understood hyperandrogenism is the result of the balance derangement between Androgen hormone levels and LH/FSH levels. The exact mechanism for how this is caused is not entirely understood, but research supports the thought that peripheral conversion of estrogen into androgens by adipose tissue is one mechanism for elevating serum androgen levels and depleting estrogen. [3] Hyperinsulinemia secondary to insulin resistance is thought to play a role in PCOS. During puberty, it is common for a degree of Insulin resistance to be seen resulting from insulin-growth factor-1 (IGF-1). This process is considered largely normal if IR is confined to glucose metabolism. In women with PCOS, IR affects multiple systems, including the liver, resulting in decreased sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) synthesis. Reduced SHBG levels contribute to the elevation of free androgens, further deranging the hormone balance. [3] Immature hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis Anovulation that presents with irregular menstruation in adolescent females as a result of an immature hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis can be a common, expected finding. An anovulatory pattern of menstruation can be seen during the first year after the onset of menarche and persist till 18. The HPO axis is believed to have reached maturation. Persistent irregularities should be further evaluated for \u201cnon-functional\u201d causes of inoculation. [13] [14] [13]", "contents": "Physiology, Ovulation -- Clinical Significance. Group II Disorders: HPO axis dysfunction, which is responsible for 85% of anovulatory cases. The most common cause of female infertility in the United States is ovulatory dysfunction, in which a variety of hormonal factors interfere with the complex sequence of hormonal events required to trigger ovulation. Problems can occur at any point in this pathway (hypothalamus, pituitary, ovary) and can lead to failure to ovulate.

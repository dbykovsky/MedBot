Each category carries out a general type of reaction but catalyzes many different specific reactions within their own category. Some enzymes, called apoenzymes, are inactive until they are bound to a cofactor, which activates the enzyme. A cofactor can be either metal ions (e.g., Zn) or organic compounds that attach, either covalently or noncovalently, to the enzyme. The cofactor and apoenzyme complex is called a holoenzyme. Enzymes are proteins comprised of amino acids linked together in one or more polypeptide chains. This sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain is called the primary structure. This, in turn, determines the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme, including the shape of the active site.

Stabilization of O/W emulsion is often performed with hydrophilic-hydrophobic particles. The hydrophilic end of the emulsifier molecule has an affinity for water, and the hydrophobic end is drawn to the fat/oil. Vigorously mixing the emulsifier with the water and oil creates a stable emulsion. For example, milk is oil in the water type of emulsion. In this mixture, fat globules are dispersed in the water. Emulsion water in oil (W/O) is composed of an aqueous phase dispersed in the oil phase. A water-in-oil emulsion is much fattier than a direct emulsion. Margarine is a water-in-oil emulsion. Other emulsions, such as oil in water in oil, or water in oil in water, exist as well.

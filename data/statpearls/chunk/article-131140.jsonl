Fortunately, manipulation yields favorable outcomes in its management. The most prevalent type of ankle sprain is a supination or inversion ankle sprain. [14] During such sprains, the talus and distal fibula become restricted anteriorly, resulting in anterior translation of the distal fibular head and posterior translation of the fibular head. This condition leads to external rotation of the tibia, accompanied by the anteromedial glide of the tibial plateau, generating a torsional force coupled with internal femoral rotation. Consequently, femoral positioning may trigger posterior innominate rotation and sacral torsion.

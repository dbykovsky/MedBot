Prognosis\u00a0\u2014\u00a0The prognosis of NBTE has not undergone formal evaluation. However, clinical experience and data from retrospective studies suggest that the prognosis is grim despite anticoagulation due to the strong association between NBTE and advanced malignancy. Similarly, in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), one six-year longitudinal cross-sectional study reported poor outcomes due to recurrent stroke (25 percent), cognitive disability (24 percent), and death (9 percent).

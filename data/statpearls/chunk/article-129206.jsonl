Janssens et al. reviewed various studies and found options to halt the unreasonable demand for laboratory tests. Education and awareness play a vital role, particularly in a teaching university hospital with residents under training. However, it has been found to have limited success due to these institutions' short-term educational opportunities.", "contents": "Overview on Ordering and Evaluation of Laboratory Tests -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

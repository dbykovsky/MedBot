The limb bud formation depends on many factors, which include the apical ectodermal ridge (AER), HOX genes, retinoic acid, sonic hedgehog (SHH) genes, and the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA). The AER forms via a thickening of the distal ectodermic border and produces signals that initiate rapid undifferentiated growth of the mesenchyme of the underlying progress zone, beginning limb formation. Retinoic acid acts to initiate transcription factor production and growth of the limbs by upregulating HOX genes and SHH genes, which then leads to synchronized limb outgrowth along the anteroposterior, dorsoventral, and proximo-distal axes of growth. Additionally, the T-box transcription factor Tbx4 is expressed in the development of the lower limbs and produces a growth factor, Fgf10, which acts at the AER to stimulate mitosis and further limb growth. The ZPA is a collection of cells that lie close to the AER on the posterior aspect of the limb and moves distally with the AER as the limb grows. The ZPA releases retinoic acid as well, which controls the development and growth of the limb along the anteroposterior axis. SHH and Fgf products promote HOX gene expression, leading to more complex limb polarization and regional formation of the developing limb. Errors in HOX gene expression, as well as T-box gene expression, can lead to malformations of limbs or changes in limb morphology.

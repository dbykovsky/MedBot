This period of poor PO intake lasts from 1 to 3 days. The pathophysiology of AKA starts with low glycogen stores and a lack of oral food intake, which shifts the metabolism from Carbohydrates to fats and lipids. Decreased oral intake causes decreased insulin levels and increased counter-regulatory hormones such as cortisol, glucagon, and epinephrine. The lack of insulin also allows an increase in the activity of hormone-sensitive lipase. These changes are further enhanced as ethanol is metabolized to acetaldehyde and acetyl-CoA, leading to an increased NADH/NAD+ ratio. The resultant increased NADH/NAD+ ratio increases lipid metabolism. All of these changes\u00a0increase the breakdown of lipids to ketoacids. The elevated NADH/NAD+ ratio further encourages the conversion of acetoacetate to beta-hydroxybutyrate. Beta-hydroxybutyrate is the predominant ketoacid in AKA. Ketoacids further accumulate as dehydration and decreased renal perfusion limit the removal of ketoacids. The differential diagnosis includes other causes of an increased anion gap metabolic acidosis. In a patient with diabetes, there must also be a consideration of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

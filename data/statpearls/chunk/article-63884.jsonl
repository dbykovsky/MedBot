[13] Standardized patients (SPs) provide an opportunity for the medical learner to immerse and interact in patient-care scenarios that evoke or replicate substantial aspects of actual clinical practice with planned attention to the psychological and physical safety of learners and SPs and without risk of harm to an actual patient. [14] [9] Two exam formats have emerged that utilize a standardized patient methodology to assess medical learners' clinical skills, competence, and performance - the Objective Structured Clinical Exam (OSCE) and the Clinical Skills Assessment (CSA). \u00a0An OSCE is comprised of multiple focused stations to assess discrete clinical skills, including data and image interpretation, technical skills, communication skills, or physical exam skills. [15] [16] [17] [18] An OSCE station may include a standardized patient if the objective is best accomplished via a simulated patient encounter, e.g., communication or counseling skills. Similarly, the CSA is an OSCE-like multi-station exam designed to assess a broad sample of clinical skills and competencies. However, unlike the focused OSCE, a CSA station has extended time and breadth and importantly, includes an SP in each station. The CSA assesses the medical learner's ability to integrate and apply multiple skills in each station, e.g., communication, physical exam, diagnostic, and professionalism. [17] Notably, OSCEs and CSAs may be formative or summative assessments of medical learners' clinical skills and competency. Formative assessments aim at providing feedback to the learner, and summative assessments focus on ensuring proficiency and accountability.

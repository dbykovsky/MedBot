The study concluded that long-term mortality was lower in spinal cord infarct patients after adjusting for age and functional scores in the acute phase. The better prognosis is likely because spinal cord infarction patients have lower frequencies of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and cardiac disease. [19] The same study found that many patients with spinal cord infarction made significant clinical improvements which improved prognosis. The determination was that in the long run, most of the surviving patients over 60 years of age at the time of injury had returned to their jobs. On the other hand, re-employment was lower among stroke patients less\u00a0than 60 years at the onset even when their functional scores are better than those of spinal cord infarction patients. Cerebral infarction patients are likely to have cognitive deficits, yet the prevalence of cognitive deficits is rare among spinal cord infarction patients and probably do not differ from those in other hospitalized patients with an equally serious condition. [19] [14] Chronic pain is a common finding in spinal cord infarction patients with up to 79% of patients reporting chronic pain on follow-up. There is also a low incidence of depression in these patients, which is likely attributable to their preserved cognitive functioning. Higher mortality in the spinal cord infraction population is associated with older age, the severity of impairments in the acute phase and the presence of peripheral vascular disease. [14] The prognosis for ventral cord syndrome will depend in large part to the initial degree of impairment upon injury. In general, studies seem to conclude that the less severe the impairment, the better the outcome. [20] [21] Further, the initial severity of the impairment, especially motor deficits, is the best predictor of functional recovery."}

With that said, spinal cord injury increases the risk of many medical complications and morbidities most of which result from the resulting paralysis and extreme inactivity. Physical inactivity itself is responsible for insulin resistance, carbohydrate metabolism disorders, and dyslipidemia. Calcifications in the coronary arteries are more prevalent in spinal cord injury patients as compared to their able-bodied counterparts. Patients are at increased risk for fractures and osteoporosis because of immobility. There is a reduction in circulating growth hormone and testosterone. The lifetime risk of pressure ulcers is estimated to be around 50% in patients with spinal cord injury. There are also adverse changes\u00a0to soft tissue body composition with increased adiposity and a reduction in skeletal muscle. Diffuse gastrointestinal tract dysmotility often brings about other problems such as gastrointestinal reflux and difficulty in evacuations. Respiratory dysfunction can arise\u00a0depending on the level and completeness of the injury. Patients with spinal cord injury above the sixth thoracic vertebra have deficits in both cardiac and peripheral vascular mechanisms which are needed to maintain blood pressure; thus they are often hypotensive.

OCT is highly reproducible and is widely used as an adjunct in routine glaucoma patient management. Peripapillary RNFL analysis (see Image. Normal Visual Field and Optical Coherence Tomography [OCT] Results) can show thinning in this layer. As the most commonly used scanning protocol for glaucoma diagnosis, it samples RGCs from the entire retina. [88] Some of the drawbacks included variability in ONH morphology from patient to patient. The macular thickness is proposed as a means of glaucoma detection, given that 50% of RGCs are found in the macula, and RGC bodies are thicker than their axons and potentially easier to detect. [89] RNFL, macular thickness measurements, and visual field results are key in managing cases."}

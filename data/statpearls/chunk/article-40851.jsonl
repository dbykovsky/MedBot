Iron deficiency is the\u00a0most common nutritional deficiency in an RYGB\u00a0patient, with a 30% to 50% prevalence. Iron absorption is promoted when exposed to gastric acid and duodenal proteolytic enzymes resulting in molecular transformations. It can be absorbed at any level in the intestinal tract but is the most efficient in the\u00a0duodenum. Deficiency in RYGB patients is due to the bypass of the mechanism mentioned above of absorption or slow chronic bleeding from marginal ulceration.

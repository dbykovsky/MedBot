As a result, 2 of 15 species of Pteroinae, including the common lionfish ( Pterois miles ), are well-established across the east coast of the United States posing a monumental threat to coral reef life in the Caribbean. It is important for divers in these areas to recognize and avoid skin contact with lionfish due to the consequences of their envenomation. Many divers hunt lionfish as a service to the health of the reef, but this should be done very carefully wearing gloves and other protective gear to avoid getting pierced by the spines.", "contents": "Lionfish, Scorpionfish, and Stonefish Toxicity -- Etiology.

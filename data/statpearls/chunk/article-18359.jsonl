A common strategy for performing cystography is to clamp the Foley catheter and allow the bladder to fill passively before a CT scan. This practice is discouraged by the EAST guideline on bladder trauma because the bladder may not reliably distend with variation in urine production. [11] The standard protocol, according to the American College of Radiology,\u00a0is to actively distend the bladder with 300 to 400 mL of contrast material via the Foley catheter prior to the CT scan. [20] A retrospective study found that only 59% of patients with bladder injuries received appropriate bladder imaging on the initial presentation. [21] Another study at a level I trauma center found that among patients with bladder trauma who underwent standard CT without a cystography component, 13% were misdiagnosed and inappropriately underwent surgical exploration. [22] Therefore, it is important to follow proper imaging protocols with consultation from\u00a0experts to avoid serious morbidity and mortality of a missed or misdiagnosed bladder injury. In a trauma setting, the primary repair of EP bladder injury while the patient is undergoing an operation for a different indication has been associated with reduced ICU stay, the overall length of stay, and complication rates.

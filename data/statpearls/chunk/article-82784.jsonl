Patients should be aware of the diagnosis and the related implications. For hospitalized patients, staff should establish close follow-up before discharge to facilitate continuity of care. Repeat assessment of serum sodium and other laboratory studies related to the causative etiology are reasonable to ensure resolution or improvement. Patients should understand that pseudohyponatremia does not appear to connect to an increased risk of morbidity or mortality; however, future treatment should address the health issues surrounding the spurious lab value."}
{"id": "article-82784_29", "title": "Pseudohyponatremia -- Pearls and Other Issues", "content": "Some of the standard pearls to treat pseudohyponatremia are as follows: Hyponatremia is defined as a serum sodium level of less than 135 mEq/L. When considering pseudohyponatremia, a careful review of the history of the present illness, past medical history, medications, and a physical examination to exclude true hyponatremia should occur. Serum osmolality is necessary to further characterize the low sodium level in hyponatremia. Pseudohyponatremia is associated with normal serum osmolality, defined as a value between 280 and 300 mOsm/kg. Hyponatremia treatment varies significantly based on serum osmolality and evaluation of volume status, and misdiagnosis can result in improper management with potentially fatal outcomes. Hence, before diagnosing pseudohyponatremia, it is essential to exclude true hyponatremia or hyponatremia caused by the presence of an osmotically active solute.", "contents": "Pseudohyponatremia -- Pearls and Other Issues.

The most common etiologies are disease states predisposing the patient to abnormal cholesterol components or protein accumulation in the blood. Management of pseudohyponatremia focuses on the treatment of the underlying disorder. Pseudohyponatremia, although a laboratory error, does not inherently pose an increased risk of morbidity or mortality. However, many conditions associated with pseudohyponatremia correlate with elevated health risks. In many cases, direct measurement of serum sodium level with direct potentiometry is unnecessary.

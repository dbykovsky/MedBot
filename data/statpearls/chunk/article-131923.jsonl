Generally, periodontal surgery can be performed using standard local anesthesia techniques with typical dental anesthetics such as 2% lidocaine/1:100,000 epinephrine. Two percent lidocaine/1:50,000 epinephrine administered locally just before incisions can be helpful to control bleeding during flap incision and elevation. Long-lasting anesthetics such as bupivacaine can be used immediately after surgery for improved pain control and to reduce the need for analgesic medication. Periodontal surgery personnel may choose to prescribe preemptive non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for pain control\u00a0and antibiotic prophylaxis in patients at risk for infections. Similarly, dexamethasone may be prescribed to reduce postoperative swelling and swelling-related postoperative pain if bone graft materials or biologics containing growth factors are used."}

The recommendation is then to add 5 to 10 pounds (2 - 4.5 kg) for each level of injury, for example for a dislocation at C5, an initial 10 to 15 pounds is placed, and then an additional 25 to 50 pounds (2 - 4.5 kg) is added incrementally, done with serial neurologic exams. [6] If a patient is obtunded or not able to cooperate with serial neurologic exams, an MRI is necessary before attempts at closed reduction and operative fixation. [6] An anterior discectomy can be utilized to help remove a herniated cervical disc but also the gain reduction of a dislocated facet. Once reduced, the surgeon can perform a fusion. Again, based on the injury extent, this may need to be combined with a posterior approach. [2]"}

High-altitude headache has been well studied and reportedly occurs in almost 80% of individuals who ascend to heights above 3000 meters.

[9] Finally, there are suspicions that metabolic failure in the setting of deficient mitochondrial energy metabolism might have a role in the pathogenesis of headaches. This failure is present in the setting of hypoxia in between migraine attacks and may sensitize migraine patients to hypoxia. [10]", "contents": "Turtle Headache -- Pathophysiology.

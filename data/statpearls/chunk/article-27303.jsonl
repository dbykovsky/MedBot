To do this, physicians rely predominately on their physical exam skills. Findings, such as edema, jugular venous distension, moist mucus membranes, and crackles on lung auscultation, all suggest that a patient is volume overloaded.

[3] The Plamsam volume (ePV) has also served as a repository of inflammatory cytokines that increase the thrombotic risk in patients, particularly those with cardiovascular problems and patients having myeloproliferative disease. [4] However, specific disease pathologies can lead to a shift of intravascular fluid into the extravascular space, leading to edema on clinical presentation, but in actuality, the patient is intravascularly depleted. The question then becomes, what can clinicians do to improve their diagnostic skills? One option is to use an ultrasound to look at the diameter and compressibility of the inferior vena cava (IVC). If the IVC is smaller in diameter and easily compressible, then this suggests that the patient is hypovolemic. Another more invasive option is to check central venous pressure (CVP). Unfortunately, the CVP is affected by multiple factors, which makes it less reliable.", "contents": "Plasma Volume Study -- Introduction.

Blood volume consists of two components, the red cell volume (RCV) and the plasma volume (PV). The RCV is composed of red blood cells (RBCs), which carry oxygen.

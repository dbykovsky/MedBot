Preoperative echocardiographic evaluation of the tricuspid valve requires coordination between the sonographer and the cardiologist. In the intraoperative environment, closed-loop communication between the surgeon, anesthesiologist, cardiologist, circulating nurse, and srub technician is vital for successful tricuspid valve repair. A detailed handoff to the receiving critical care team is essential in improving the outcomes and minimizing adverse events.", "contents": "Tricuspid Valve Repair -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

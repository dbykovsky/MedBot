For example, one could position an automatic blood pressure cuff distal to the vein segment being interrogated, inflate\u00a0the\u00a0cuff to 80 mmHg, wait 4 seconds, and then deflate the cuff. The duration of reversed color flow after relaxation is measured. Pulsed Doppler helps quantify the reflux time and volume. Any reflux or reversed flow lasting longer than 0.5 seconds in the superficial system or 1.0 seconds in the deep system is considered clinically significant. [40] [41]"}

There is often overlap between who is medically managing and treating the patient. Peripheral venous disease is at an interface involving interventional radiologists, interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons, hematologists/oncologists, and primary care physicians. This interplay can lead to confusing and sometimes counterproductive recommendations.

Any patients diagnosed with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth should have additional testing to determine the etiology and treatment against the underlying condition to prevent recurrent SIBO. Treatment of disorders associated with abnormal intestinal motility, including Crohn's disease, irritable bowel syndrome, post-radiation enteropathy, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and scleroderma, should be better optimized and well-controlled. Prokinetics can be useful as adjunctive therapy for these patients. [35] Opioids, which decrease intestinal motility, and proton pump inhibitors, which cause achlorhydria, should be avoided in these patients. [36] Surgical interventions can be considered in patients with anatomical abnormalities who have recurrent SIBO. [35] There is limited research on chronic antibiotic prophylaxis, and probiotics are ineffective in prevention.

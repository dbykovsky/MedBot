This procedure involves artificial valve placement through central venous access. The success rate of this procedure is about 94% to 98%. Procedural complication rates are between 3% to 6%, among which coronary artery compression is the most important one. Another advantage of this procedure is very little hospitalization time (4-5 days), and patients will be able to go back to their work immediately post-discharge. Infective endocarditis forms the most important delayed complication. [15]"}

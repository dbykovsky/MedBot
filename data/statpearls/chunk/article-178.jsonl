The most common mechanism for acute myocardial ischemia represents coronary artery plaque rupture that results in thrombosis and leads to either partial or complete occlusion of the coronary artery. [3] Other mechanisms of acute myocardial ischemia requiring acknowledgment in the current era where effective medical therapy significantly decreased the risk of plaque rupture are plaque erosion, microvascular disease, vasospasm, and restenosis after stenting. [4] The basis for UA and NSTEMI differentiation is the presence of biomarkers of myocardial damage (cardiac-specific troponins) in the blood sample of patients with NSTEMI and the lack of those in patients with UA. STEMI refers to acute coronary syndrome accompanied with ST elevations in the electrocardiogram (ECG) with concomitant or subsequent appearance of biomarkers of myocardial injury.

Reperfusion therapy can be a fibrinolytic agent or a form of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The choice of the reperfusion strategy will depend on the estimation of the time that will be necessary for the administration of reperfusion therapy. In the case of fibrinolysis, that time is referred to as door-to-needle, while in the case of PCI, it is door-to-balloon time.

Upon deciding about whether or not to use fibrinolysis, it should preferably occur within the first 30 minutes of the first medical contact. This strategy can be achieved either as prehospital fibrinolysis by the emergency medical service (EMS) provider or within 30 minutes of arriving at a non-PCI capable facility (door to needle time). Contraindications to fibrinolysis require prompt review if this strategy is an option. Absolute contraindications are any previous intracranial hemorrhage, ischemic stroke in the past 3 months, central nervous system neoplasm or arteriovenous malformation, major head trauma or surgery within the past month, known active bleeding or bleeding diathesis (with the exception of menses), suspected aortic dissection, severe uncontrolled hypertension unresponsive to emergent medical therapy and use of streptokinase in the last 6 months. [7] Some relative contraindications include a history of chronic poorly controlled hypertension, surgery in the last 3 months, ischemic stroke more than 3 months ago, traumatic or prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and any other unspecified intracranial pathology. Some factors merit consideration when considering fibrinolysis based on the available evidence from the recent clinical studies. Mortality reduction in patients with STEMI who are undergoing fibrinolysis is the highest within the first 4 hours, being around 80% after 2 hours and less than 20% after 4 hours of symptom onset. [13] Patients with developed collateral circulation may have more significant benefits beyond the 2-hour timeframe when compared to patients without collateral circulation. The CAPTIM trial compared prehospital fibrinolysis with PCI in patients with STEMI and found that patients who received treatment with pre-hospital fibrinolysis within 2 hours of symptoms onset had better survival when compared to PCI strategy.

Other cases require evaluation on a case-by-case basis with careful consideration of risks and benefits. Upon deciding for a fibrinolytic strategy, agents that are fibrin-specific and given as a bolus (such as tenecteplase and reteplase) are preferred to other agents due to demonstrated lower risk of intracerebral bleeding and are more convenient to use.

This type of treatment has the name triple therapy. In the most recent ACC/AHA guideline on UA/NSTEMI, the recommendation is that patients who had ACS and underwent PCI should receive triple therapy, but with making every effort to minimize the duration to limit the risk of bleeding. [55] Literature reports unequivocally increased risk of bleeding in patients who are on triple therapy when compared to DAPT or single antiplatelet agent. [55] [91] [92] Several strategies have been proposed to mitigate those risks. These include the use of clinical calculators such as HAS-BLED to assess bleeding risk, evaluating the appropriateness of indication for anticoagulation, targeting the international normalized ratio (INR) to 2 to 2.5 when using warfarin, the use of clopidogrel instead of more potent P2Y12 inhibitors, and the use of proton pump inhibitors in patients with a prior history or at risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. [90] The most recent guidelines for the management of ACS recommend that triple therapy continues for six months following PCI in patients with lower bleeding risk, assessed by HAS-BLED score is equal to or less than 2, followed by\u00a0an\u00a0oral anticoagulant (OAC)\u00a0and clopidogrel or aspirin for the remaining 6 months. [7] [11] [55] In patients with HAS-BLED score of 3 and above, the recommendation is that triple therapy should be administered for one month, followed by an oral anticoagulant (OAC) and clopidogrel or aspirin for the total duration of 12 months. The choice of OAC involves a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) or a non-VKA novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC), based on the patient's preference and other socioeconomic factors. The decision between aspirin and clopidogrel during the period of treatment with OAC and one antiplatelet agent depends on the balance of ischemic risks such as complex coronary stenting, left main disease, bifurcation lesions, patients with diabetes, and bleeding risks such as a history of major bleeding and predisposition for future bleeding events. After 12 months of the described treatment, the guidelines recommend that OAC should be continued as a monotherapy indefinitely for the original indication. [7] [11] [55] In patients with ACS who did not undergo revascularization or have undergone CABG, the recommendation is that dual therapy involving OAC and aspirin or clopidogrel should continue for 12 months, and after completing that time, OAC should remain in place. Regardless of the type of revascularization, patients with high ischemic risk may continue OAC and aspirin beyond the 12-month time frame. Several recent trial results have disputed the concept of triple therapy and examined the effect of OAC along with P2Y12 inhibitor in patients with ACS who are undergoing PCI. [93] [94] [95] [96] WOEST, PIONEER-AF, RE-DUAL [96] , and AUGUSTUS trials have examined the efficacy and safety of\u00a0warfarin, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, and apixaban, respectively, in conjunction with clopidogrel for treatment of patients with ACS who underwent PCI, compared to treatment with triple therapy. [93] [95] [96] [97] Based on the reported results, it appears that dual therapy with an anticoagulant agent and P2Y12 inhibitor, when compared to triple therapy, significantly decreases the bleeding risk, while ischemic and thromboembolic risk remains unchanged. Based on these studies, new practice-changing guidelines are warranted, and the data requires interpretation for safe use in clinical practice. The ongoing ENTRUST-PCI study (NCT02866175) will provide data on edoxaban in this type of clinical scenario.

However, a few alterations can be made to make the procedure less challenging. Narang et al. developed a no-assistant technique (NAT), which works on the principle of vector forces. [17] Once the leading haptic is externalized, the trailing haptic is flexed inside the eye. As it crosses the mid-pupillary plane close to the 6 o\u2019clock position, vector forces act in a way that further extrudes the leading haptic, minimizing chances of slippage back into the eye. Beiko et al. described the use of silicone retainer tires from iris and capsular hooks to secure the leading haptic while the trailing haptic is being externalized."}

One modification involves the position of the initial scleral flaps. Partial-thickness scleral flaps are usually made at 3 and 9 o\u2019clock positions if the white-to-white (WTW) distance is 11 mm or less. However, in certain cases, such as Marfan syndrome, the WTW distance may be 12 mm or more. In such conditions, to ensure that an adequate length of the haptics can be externalized, the flaps are made at 6 and 12 o\u2019clock positions, as the vertical diameter of the cornea is less than the horizontal.", "contents": "Scleral Fixation of Intraocular Lenses -- Technique or Treatment -- Techniques of Sutureless SFIOL Using Scleral Tunnel With Scleral Flaps.

This shifts the IOL plane anteriorly, thereby allowing haptics to traverse a lesser distance and allowing greater haptic externalization. However, these modifications may be associated with their own set of complications, such as iridodialysis, intraoperative bleeding, and pigmentary disturbances. Some of these complications are preventable by doing a prior vitrector-assisted peripheral iridectomy.

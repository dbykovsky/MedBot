It also contains phenolic compounds, approximately ten, and polyacetylenes, sesquiterpenes, alkaloids, and polysaccharides. [2] Tumor growth inhibition is primarily via cell cycle inhibition, specifically cyclin-dependent kinases and cyclins in the G0/G1 phase, as well as its ability to remove reactive oxygen species and suppress angiogenesis of tumor cells. Apoptotic mechanisms have also been shown to occur via upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins. Not only does ginsengs display a wide effect on cancer, but evidence demonstrates differentiation in leukemia, where it causes increased production of hemoglobin.

[3] There are three types of commercial ginseng available: Korean, Chinese, and American. [2] Fresh ginseng tends to degrade easily, so it is commonly dried or steamed. [2] The time to reach peak plasma concentration after oral administrations of ginseng was approximately four hours. [7] Pharmacokinetic studies in rabbits have shown a range of elimination half-lives between 0.8 and 7.4 hours for certain ginsenosides and between nineteen and twenty-one hours for longer-acting ginsenosides; therefore, discontinuation should be at least twenty-four hours preoperatively.

Metabolic processes that increase CO 2 production may include fever, thyrotoxicosis, increased catabolism in sepsis or steroid use, overfeeding, metabolic acidosis, and exercise. Respiratory failure in this pathology is a failure to eliminate CO 2 from the pulmonary system, which is synonymous with hypoventilation secondary to decreased respiratory rate or decreased tidal volume. [4] This is from decreased central nervous system respiratory drive, anatomical defects, decreased neuromuscular response, or increased dead space within the lung. It is also technically possible to develop hypercapnia through exposure and inhalation of environmental air rich in CO 2 . Depending on the etiology, hypercapnia can be an acute process or a chronic process. These can be distinguished through the evaluation of the pH. [5] Acute hypercapnia\u00a0will have PaCO2 elevated above the normal reference range of 45 mm Hg, and the HCO 3 level will be within normal limits at approximately 30 mm Hg with a resulting proportional decrease in pH on blood gas evaluation below 7.35. Chronic hypercapnia\u00a0allows for renal compensation to the elevated CO 2 levels within the blood. As a result, PaCO 2 will be elevated above the normal reference range of 45 mm Hg, and the HCO 3 level will also be elevated proportionally, resulting in a less severe pH imbalance in the low-normal range.

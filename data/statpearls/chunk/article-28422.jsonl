In mitochondria, digested nutrients undergo metabolic reactions, end up at the level of the electron transport chain, and release high-energy compounds (eg, adenosine triphosphate). The main byproduct of this process, carbon dioxide, gets released in the venous blood, returning to the lungs. Carbon dioxide diffuses through alveolar walls and dissolves in exhaled air. The respiratory rate\u00a0(ie, the number of breaths per minute) is highly regulated to enable cells to produce the optimum energy at any given\u00a0occasion. A complex nervous system of nerve tissues governs the rate of oxygen inflow and carbon dioxide outflow. It adjusts it accordingly in conditions that derange partial gas pressures in blood. Respiration involves the brain, brainstem, respiratory muscles, lungs, airways, and blood vessels.

In patients with Tay Sachs disease (hexosaminidase-A deficiency), findings suggest that antipsychotic drugs deplete hexosaminidase-A and worsen the course of the disease. Some other contraindications to the use of antipsychotics are glaucoma, liver disease, severe neutropenia, or bone\u00a0marrow depression. [32] [33] [34]"}

By blocking dopamine receptors, second-generation antipsychotics can cause extrapyramidal symptoms and neuroleptic malignant syndrome, although to a lesser extent, compared to a typical antipsychotic, eg, haloperidol. Alpha-adrenergic blockade causes orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia via vasodilation. Olanzapine, clozapine, aripiprazole, and quetiapine cause significant anti-alpha-adrenergic effects. Almost all atypical agents block serotonin receptors, and several inhibit muscarinic receptors. Quetiapine, clozapine, and olanzapine are powerful anti-muscarinic agents, and toxicity can cause urinary retention, tachycardia, hyperthermia, and delirium. Many second-generation antipsychotics also cause significant sedation by antihistamine activity; these agents are aripiprazole, quetiapine, clozapine, and olanzapine. Olanzapine causes central nervous system depression, hypotension, sedation, and sometimes agitation and is rarely lethal in monotherapy overdose.", "contents": "Atypical Antipsychotic Agents -- Toxicity.

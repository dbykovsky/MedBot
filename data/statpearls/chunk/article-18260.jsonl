The differentiation of bicornuate from the septate uterus is critical due to the contrast in their management approach. A septate uterus is managed via hysteroscopic resection as opposed to bicornuate, which requires a unification of uterus. In such a case, MRI helps differentiate fusion anomalies from resorption anomalies. [14]", "contents": "Bicornuate Uterus -- Differential Diagnosis. A bicornuate uterus is with a longitudinal vaginal septum in some cases, which makes it difficult to differentiate from uterus didelphys. In such cases, look for the presence of soft tissue between 2 uterine cavities, which establishes the diagnosis of a bicornuate uterus.

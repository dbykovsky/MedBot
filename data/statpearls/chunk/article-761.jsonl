{"id": "article-761_9", "title": "Physiology, Smooth Muscle -- Mechanism", "content": "Smooth muscle contraction depends on calcium influx. Calcium increases within the smooth muscle cell through two different processes. First, depolarization, hormones, or neurotransmitters cause calcium to\u00a0enter the cell through L-type channels located\u00a0in the caveolae of the membrane. Intracellular calcium then stimulates the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) by way of ryanodine receptors and IP3; this process is referred to as calcium-induced calcium release. [7] Unlike skeletal muscle, smooth muscle calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum does not physically couple to the ryanodine receptor. Once calcium has entered the cell, it is free to bind calmodulin, which transforms into activated calmodulin. Calmodulin then activates the enzyme myosin light chain kinase (MLCK),\u00a0MLCK then phosphorylates a regulatory light chain on myosin. Once phosphorylation\u00a0has occurred, a conformational change takes place in the myosin head; this increases myosin ATPase activity, which promotes interaction between\u00a0the myosin head and actin. Cross-bridge cycling then occurs, generating tension. The tension generated is relative to the amount of calcium concentration within the cell. ATPase activity is much lower in smooth muscle than it is in skeletal muscle. This factor leads to a much slower cycling speed of smooth muscle. However, the more extended period of contraction leads to a potentially greater force of contraction in smooth muscle. Smooth muscle contraction is enhanced even further through the use of connexins.

Atherosclerosis, once thought to be only a function of hemodynamics and vessel structure, has more recently been linked to smooth muscle development. [4] Research has even shown that continuous vascular smooth muscle activation can lead to the formation of pulmonary hypertension. [14] Within the lungs, pathologic activation of smooth muscle can lead to the development of asthma. Asthma occurs when smooth muscle constriction leads to obstruction of the airway. Recent studies have shown that the smooth muscle layer may increase in thickness before the onset of asthma even occurs, pointing towards a potential genetic link. [15]"}

[16] With such a significant health care burden, it is astonishing to realize that asthma results from something as simple as smooth muscle contraction. Smooth muscle is an integral\u00a0part of the human body; its function is required for life and is present in almost every organ system. In the cardiovascular system, smooth muscle is used in vessels to maintain blood pressure and flow; in the lungs, it opens and closes airways; in the gastrointestinal system it plays a role in motility and nutrition collection; and yet it still serves a purpose\u00a0in almost every other organ system\u00a0as well.\u00a0The wide distribution of smooth muscle throughout the body and its many unique properties make it imperative for medical professionals to have an in-depth\u00a0understanding of its physiology, function, and disease applications.", "contents": "Physiology, Smooth Muscle -- Clinical Significance.

If the patient feels liquid in the back of the throat during the procedure, the RFA needle should be withdrawn slightly and retested. If proper stimulation is achieved, a local anesthetic should be injected to anesthetize the area. If the patient does not report a liquid feeling in the back of the throat, the radiofrequency ablation should be completed, and the patient should then be monitored for any symptoms such as bleeding or infection."}

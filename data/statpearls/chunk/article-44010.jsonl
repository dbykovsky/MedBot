Although\u00a0various agents have shown potential, a single strategy for improving treatment options for\u00a0AKI has failed to\u00a0show utility in clinical care. [32] [33] [34] When perioperative acute kidney injury develops, goal-directed therapy to reach adequate cardiac output and oxygen delivery levels has been documented to reduce mortality resulting from AKI. [35] Unfortunately, studies have shown that developing lactic acidosis or hypotension intraoperatively is\u00a0a\u00a0late indicator of decreased renal perfusion. As such, cardiac output and renal blood flow should be maintained with aggressive fluid resuscitation, and when fluids alone are insufficient, inotropes are necessary.\u00a0A\u00a0reasonably liberal fluid administration regimen is safer than a highly restricted one for fluid resuscitation of patients in the perioperative period.

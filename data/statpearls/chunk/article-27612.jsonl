One issue is that preventive medicine is less profitable than other measures. Another problem is that our understanding of individual risk for individual diseases is lacking. For example, while we know that risk factors such as smoking and pollution increase a population\u2019s rate of lung cancer, we cannot reliably predict the risk of lung cancer in a given individual even if smoking and pollution status is known; after all, not every person who smokes or lives next to a freeway will develop lung cancer. As a result, our current approach to preventative medicine is to apply a one-fits-all intervention universally; seatbelts, vaccinations, diet, and exercise are prime examples.", "contents": "Predictive Medicine -- Definition/Introduction.

This is the goal of predictive medicine, the practice of obtaining and cataloging characteristics about individual patients, analyzing that data to predict the patient\u2019s individual risk for an outcome of interest, predicting which treatment in which individual will be most effective, and then intervening before the outcome occurs.Traditionally, predictive medicine was exclusively confined to the realm of genetics. It was once thought that genetics would revolutionize medicine and, in fact, genetics and genomics have improved our ability to predict individual risk for some diseases (e.g., the BRCA gene and breast cancer) and predict which treatment will be more effective in a given individual (e.g., therapy directed at a molecular target in cancer). However, genetics-based risk prediction has proven of limited benefit for reasons including (1) whole-genome sequencing is still relatively expensive and not currently\u00a0covered by insurance, and (2) the majority of diseases afflicting the population today is multifactorial. For example, heart disease is influenced not only by genetics but also by age, diet, exercise, and stress levels.

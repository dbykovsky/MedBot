In a 1998 consensus statement, the term \"Shy Drager syndrome\" was formally taken out of use and placed under the categorization of \"multiple system atrophy\" (MSA). [2] Multiple system atrophy has been further categorized into MSA-P and MSA-C, depending on whether parkinsonian or cerebellar features predominate, respectively. [3] As indicated in its name, the anatomical hallmark of MSA is atrophy. Specifically, the cerebellum, pons, and putamen are the primary areas of brain involvement. MSA-P and MSA-C differ in the amount of involvement in each of these areas of the brain. In the spinal column, both MSA-P and MSA-C include the intermediolateral area of the spinal cord in addition to Onuf's nucleus and the vagal nucleus.

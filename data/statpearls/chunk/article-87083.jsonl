Post-traumatic headaches require an interprofessional team involving the patient, clinicians, pharmacists, and therapists. Providers need to identify, evaluate, and manage PTHA as it can be quite debilitating and can significantly affect the patient's quality of life after injury. While the IHS has attempted to classify PTHA based on chronology (acute versus persistent) and type of injury (mild vs. moderate/severe), there is a need to subdivide the various presentations of PTHA rather than simply by which characteristic primary headache fits the clinical presentation. Medical providers should seek to determine the primary headache phenotype and manage accordingly. Additionally, patients with chronic PTHA should be assessed for medication-induced headaches that may arise due to the overuse of abortive headache therapy. The IHS acknowledges the lack of characteristic qualities in diagnosing PTHA, and more research is needed to assist providers in its overall management. [45]"}

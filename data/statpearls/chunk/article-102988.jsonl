Chapman\u2019s points are small, tender, palpable fascial congestions deep to the subcutaneous tissue. While their exact mechanism is not completely understood, they appear to represent the somatic manifestation of a visceral dysfunction. [29] [30] Chapman\u2019s points are often described as a grain of rice or tapioca pearl found within the deep fascia and are tender upon palpation. [30] They do not refer pain when palpated. In this way, they may be differentiated from myofascial trigger points, which are similarly tender to palpation but do refer pain. [31] [32] Myofascial trigger points also appear in taut bands of muscle tissue, not the deep fascia."}

They may also assist the examining physician in narrowing the differential diagnosis when the clinical picture is unclear. When coupled with a thorough history and physical, medication reconciliation, and consideration of environmental factors (viz. common masqueraders such as tight clothing or a sunburn), somatic dysfunction can expose occult visceral dysfunction. For example, a middle-aged male with a history of primary hyperparathyroidism may present with hypertonicity in the paraspinal musculature from T10 to T11, a tender Chapman\u2019s point one inch superiorly and one inch to the left of the umbilicus, and a complaint of waxing and waning lower back pain that radiates into his groin. The chief complaint alone is suggestive of nephrolithiasis; the presence of segmentally-related tissue texture changes, and a Chapman\u2019s point further supports an illness script that illustrates renal pathology.", "contents": "Physiology, Viscerosomatic Reflexes -- Clinical Significance.

Abnormal and/or steady visceral and somatic sensory input sensitize the interneurons of the dorsal horn and lower their excitation threshold as they contemporaneously lower the threshold of the receptive fields of related somatic structures. Due to the hyperexcitability of the convergent nerves within the spinal cord and the local sensory receptors, less irritation to the somatic structure is required to potentiate an action potential through the sensory pathways, ultimately resulting in increased sensitivity to pain. Another postulate is that the increased contraction of the segmentally-related musculature due to exaggerated motor output results in some peripheral sensitization at the nociceptors within the muscles themselves. [33] [34] Given these cellular mechanisms, it is not uncommon for patients with visceral dysfunction to present with hyperalgesia of segmentally-related somatic structures.", "contents": "Physiology, Viscerosomatic Reflexes -- Clinical Significance.

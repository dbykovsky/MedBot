When tissue cysts containing bradyzoites are ingested, these will also change into tachyzoites inside the intestine. Tachyzoites then penetrate the intestinal mucosa and reach distant organs such as brain, eyes, liver, spleen, lymph nodes, heart, skeletal muscles and the placenta by blood and lymphatic stream. Dendritic cells and macrophages guide the parasite through the blood-brain barrier allowing infection of the brain and eye [9] . Maternal infection within 6 months of conception may lead to transplacental infection of the fetus resulting in congenital toxoplasmosis [9] . Disseminated tachyzoites can infect a wide variety of human cell types. Inside the host cell, T. gondii forms a parasitophorous vacuole that sequesters the parasite from phagolysosomes and the host immune response [10] . Rapid multiplication results in host cell lysis and infection of new cells. Eventually, tachyzoites will differentiate into the latent bradyzoite and form tissue cysts [11] .

Treatment with intra-ocular steroids alone is contra-indicated as it typically causes extensive retinitis.\u00a0 Two clinical trials investigated intravitreous clindamycin (1mg) and dexamethasone (0.4 mg) one injection followed by additional injections every two weeks based on clinical course. These studies indicated that intravitreous injections are a reasonable alternative to classic therapy and could even be used as\u00a0first-line treatment [35] [36] ."}

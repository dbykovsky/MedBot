Amylase is primarily used for diagnosing pancreatic diseases and is a frequently measured enzyme owing to the accessibility of cost-effective and readily automated methods. Although amylase is a sensitive marker for acute pancreatitis, its lack of specificity is evident, as it can be elevated in numerous conditions unrelated to the pancreas. [49] Pancreatitis can be defined by the presence of at least 2 out of the 3 criteria\u2014abdominal pain, serum amylase, and/or lipase levels\u2014exceeding 3 times the URL and characteristic findings of pancreatitis on abdominal imaging. Therefore, the clinical significance of amylase has been a subject of inquiry. [50] In cases of elevated amylase levels and insufficient evidence of pancreatitis, healthcare professionals should contemplate alternative causes of hyperamylasemia. [51]"}

[102] Lipase is generally favored over amylase because of its greater specificity. Lipase levels usually stay elevated for up to 2 weeks, whereas amylase concentrations tend to return to normal within 5 days. Therefore, in cases where there is a gap between symptom onset and the patient seeking medical attention, amylase is less clinically valuable compared to lipase. [18]"}

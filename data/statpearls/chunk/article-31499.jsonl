[2] On EEG, it was described by Laurino et al.\u00a0as having a short positive voltage peak, which is usually at 200 milliseconds, followed by a large negative complex at around 550 milliseconds and finally, a long-lasting positive peak at 900 milliseconds. [3] However, the initial short positive peak may not always be present. The occurrence of K-complexes may be spontaneous (spontaneous K-complex [SKC]), as a response to an internal stimulus such as a respiratory interruption or in response to an external stimulus like a touch on the skin (evoked K-complex [EKC]). Though K-complexes are generated in widespread areas of the cortex, they are seen maximally over the frontal and superior frontal cortices. [3]", "contents": "Physiology, K Complex -- Introduction.

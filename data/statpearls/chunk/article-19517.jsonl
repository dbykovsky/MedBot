Immunophenotypic analysis of the peripheral circulating lymphocytes by peripheral blood flow cytometry can be performed, which can help\u00a0confirm the clonality of circulating B cells in CLL patients. Flow cytometry can be performed on both peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate to look for the classical immunophenotypic markers of CLL. To reiterate, characteristic CLL/SLL lymphocyte phenotype features include\u00a0low levels of immunoglobulins (most often IgM immunoglobulin and sometimes both IgM and IgD); expression of B-cell associated antigens (CD19, CD20, CD21, CD23, and/or CD24); and expression of CD5 which is a T-cell associated antigen. The most common immunophenotype expression of CLL/SLL is the coexpression of CD5, CD19, and CD23. However, different levels of expression of other immunophenotypic antigens are also seen. Serum immunoglobulins and free-light chains are measured at baseline to assess the immunodeficiency and during treatment, to look at immune reconstitution, especially with the newer generation B-cell receptor signaling drugs. As for the light chain immunoglobulins, only one type of light chain suggesting the monoclonality of the lymphocytes. Rarely, some patients express both\u00a0kappa and lambda light chains, known as \"biclonal CLL.\" [38] [39] [25] [40] [41] [42] [43] [25]"}

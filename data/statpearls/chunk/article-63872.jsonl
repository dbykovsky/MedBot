Improved patient outcomes commonly occur with higher fidelity simulation. [41] [Level I] This is especially pertinent in the critical care setting\u00a0due to the high complexity and acuity of procedures performed daily. Simulation is also more effective when it involves ultrasound and other imaging modalities. [42] [Level III] The goal of high-fidelity simulation is to improve common health practices, decrease medical errors, and improve healthcare outcomes. Results are measurable via patient satisfaction scores and reduced mortality risk for high-risk procedures. In a study performed in nurses, seven 4-hour simulation sessions were offered for 3 weeks in a high-fidelity simulation center. The study analyzed code blue data after 3 months of intervention, finding that the number of code blues decreased by 14%. Although the number of code blues pre-cardiac arrest increased by 52%, the number of pulseless cardiac arrests decreased by 59%, suggesting that after receiving training, nurses were more expedient in identifying patient deterioration and activation of rapid response protocols. This study demonstrated a 16% increase in the success rate of return of spontaneous cardiac circulation after the intervention.

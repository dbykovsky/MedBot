Potential candidates require screening by a surgeon experienced in selecting the appropriate patient for HT. During the procedure, an experienced surgeon, hair technician, and operative nurse should be involved to provide the best possible outcomes and decrease morbidity. Members of the healthcare team must effectively communicate patient education. Close follow-up during the initial postoperative period is essential to monitor for complications, including infection or hematoma. This interprofessional approach will produce the best patient outcomes with minimal adverse events."}

To minimize edema and ecchymosis, advise the patient to ice the forehead for 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours, sleep with their head elevated for the first week, and avoid vigorous activity for 1 week. The patient may receive a low-dose corticosteroid taper to help lessen bruising and swelling, and postoperative antibiotics may be given to mitigate infection, though data supporting their routine use is limited. To promote wound healing and avoid scabbing: Instruct the patient to keep the affected areas moist by gently applying saline using a small spray bottle. Apply emollient to the donor site for the first several days. Wash the scalp with baby shampoo on postoperative day 3, though avoid direct contact with water from a high-pressure faucet or showerhead. Return on postoperative day 7 for suture removal.", "contents": "Hair Transplantation -- Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions.

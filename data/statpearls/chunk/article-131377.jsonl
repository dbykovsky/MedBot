A child's first dental visit is often recommended by the age of 1 as the upper incisors are usually erupted by that time. Treatments for teething vary; however, this normal process of oral development is generally treated conservatively.", "contents": "Anatomy, Head and Neck, Primary Dentition -- Clinical Significance.

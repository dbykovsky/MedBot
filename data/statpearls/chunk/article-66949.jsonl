This nephrolithiasis is associated with metabolic syndrome, obesity, and diabetes. High-purine diets tend to promote these stones. Presentation and initial treatment are similar to other urinary calculi. [85] Diagnosis is primarily by an abdominal CT scan, preferably without contrast. One can reliably diagnose uric acid stones if the urine pH exceeds\u00a05.5 and the Hounsfield units are 500 or less. Pure uric acid calculi typically are not visible on plain abdominal KUB x-rays.", "contents": "Uric Acid Nephrolithiasis -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

Urinary alkalinization is used as a prophylactic treatment, and potassium citrate is typically used. Sodium bicarbonate, sodium citrate, and magnesium citrate can be substituted for alkalinization if potassium citrate is not tolerated well or is otherwise unacceptable due to hyperkalemia. Sufficient alkalinization can also dissolve existing stones, but urinary pH needs to be at least 6.1 and optimally at least 6.5 or more to achieve dissolution.", "contents": "Uric Acid Nephrolithiasis -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

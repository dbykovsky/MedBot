Some, such as diphenoxylate and loperamide, have almost no effect other than suppression of bowel motility. Opioids such as methadone can significantly prolong the QT interval. Some opioids have serotonergic activity and can precipitate serotonin syndrome, especially when given to patients already taking various psychoactive medications\u00a0(notably antidepressant medications like SSRIs). There is an evolving body of knowledge that the intensity and quality of response to opioids can vary significantly between patients, which can be unrelated to tolerance. This is likely related to genetics but is not well characterized\u00a0at this time. [24] [21]"}

The large gas bubble exerts an upward force to tamponade the retinal break against the retinal pigment epithelium. This force results from the counterplay between two forces., i.e., gravity exerts a downward force and buoyancy, which generates an upward force. The weight of 1 mL gas is 0.001 g, and its buoyancy is 1g. Hence, it can exert an upward force of 0.999g, which is much more than the upward force produced by a SO bubble and similar to the downward force produced by a PFCL bubble. The gas bubble assumes a flat bottom due to its large upward force. This reduces the volume wasted in making the lower meniscus and maximizes the volume that contributes to making contact with the retina.

Gas: The gas stays as a single large bubble as the interfacial tension between water and gas is high. The large gas bubble exerts an upward force to tamponade the retinal break against the retinal pigment epithelium. This force results from the counterplay between two forces., i.e., gravity exerts a downward force and buoyancy, which generates an upward force. The weight of 1 mL gas is 0.001 g, and its buoyancy is 1g. Hence, it can exert an upward force of 0.999g, which is much more than the upward force produced by a SO bubble and similar to the downward force produced by a PFCL bubble. The gas bubble assumes a flat bottom due to its large upward force. This reduces the volume wasted in making the lower meniscus and maximizes the volume that contributes to making contact with the retina. This contact with the retina prevents water from entering the subretinal space through the retinal break(s). Also, the intraocular currents are reduced due to the air bubble, thus reducing water from entering the subretinal space."}

Gas : Although anterior chamber paracentesis may provide temporary relief, partial gas removal may be needed. A half water-filled syringe with plunger removed can be inserted in the vitreous through the par plana, and a few gas bubbles can be removed. SO : A single cannula can be inserted through the superior par plana, and SO can be partially removed passively."}

All the substitutes should be appropriately labeled during storage as well as usage. It should be ensured that the correct gas concentration has been achieved before injecting. It is imperative to understand that a gas injection of incorrect concentration can lead to catastrophic outcomes. The gas or air-gas mixture should be used immediately after preparation as any air influx from the surroundings can cause inaccuracy in its concentration.", "contents": "Agents for Vitreous Tamponade -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

For example, patients with pulsus paradoxus due to cardiac tamponade face typically critical conditions, and without prompt treatment, they are likely to have grave outcomes. The key is the timing of intervention; the longer the delay, the worse the outcomes. Similarly, tension pneumothorax arises from many causes and rapidly progresses to respiratory insufficiency, cardiovascular collapse, and ultimately leading to death if not recognized and treated. Uncomplicated pneumothoraces have the potential to recur within a timeframe ranging from 6 months to 3 years. Recurrences are more common in smokers, individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and patients with AIDS. [24]", "contents": "Pulsus Paradoxus -- Prognosis.

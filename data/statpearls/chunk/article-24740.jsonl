March fractures are small, nondisplaced bone breaks that occur in the metatarsals of the feet. Various causes include overuse, overtraining, incorrect shoes, pedal deformities such as pes planus and overpronation, osteopenia/osteoporosis, and incorrect training habits or surfaces. When left untreated, a complete fracture can occur."}

Symptoms are typically worse with weight-bearing activities. X-rays and MRI of the foot can help the diagnosis. Typical treatment can include rest, immobilization, decreased athletics, nutrition counseling, and occasionally surgery to stabilize and repair the fracture.", "contents": "March Fracture (Metatarsal Stress Fractures) -- Deterrence and Patient Education.

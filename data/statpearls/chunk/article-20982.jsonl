A CO saturation monitor can detect CO levels. Ratios of carboxyhemoglobin to hemoglobin greater than 10% are likely to show as symptomatic. Regular pulse oximetry devices read the percent of bound hemoglobin, irrespective of what is bound. Therefore, when CO is bound rather than O2, a patient's pulse Ox may still appear normal and cannot be used reliably. Instead, a co-oximeter should be used. Treatment for CO poisoning is to dissociate the bound CO with O2. Providing 100% supplemental oxygen via non-rebreather or administering hyperbaric oxygen are options.

Another option is administering hydroxocobalamin, a form of vitamin B12, or thiosulfate, although thiosulfate is not time efficient and typically requires combination therapy with nitrites.

Pericardial effusions can be detected and differentiated from pleural effusions, where they will be located anterior to the descending aorta and posterior pericardial reflection. Upon identifying pleural effusions, then echocardiographic signs of tamponade can be evaluated with the collapse of the RV. Furthermore, right ventricular dilation can be estimated with its clinical significance in pulmonary embolism causing right ventricular strain. [12] The left ventricle to right ventricle ratio is 1:0.6. However, right ventricular hypertrophy can exceed right ventricular dilation due to chronic pathologic processes such as pulmonary hypertension. Lastly, left ventricular (LV) contractility can be evaluated visually and via the utilization of the M-mode.

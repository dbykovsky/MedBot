When Wallerian degeneration occurs, a series of events leads to complete structural and chemical disintegration of the nerve, resulting in a more guarded prognosis. Recovery is contingent on the regeneration of the nerve, depending largely upon how well the transected nerve endings are aligned, as well as the severity of any adjacent soft tissue injury and scarring. To achieve a noticeable clinical outcome, the affected muscles and organs must become reinnervated after adequate nerve regeneration and remyelination occurs. If the pathology causing any sensory neuropathic symptoms is purely due to segmental demyelination, the prognosis will be much more positive. This is because it entails a shorter recovery and quicker return to function. Pain and temperature are typically the first sensations to recover.", "contents": "Sensory Neuropathy -- Prognosis.

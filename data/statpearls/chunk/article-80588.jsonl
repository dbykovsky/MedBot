For example, in patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia, this type of modified diet can lead to poor nutrition. The use of modified diets, including full thickened liquid diets in long-term care patients, has correlations with higher BUN and creatinine levels as well as higher rates of dehydration over time. The use of certain types of full liquid diets can also affect drug absorption. Studies have shown that using full thickened liquid diets to take medications can affect the rate of absorption\u00a0by delaying drug\u00a0dissolution. Finally, full liquid diets can affect a patient's quality of life over time due to patient dissatisfaction with taste when supplemented with nutrients, patient discomfort with\u00a0the texture of diet lacking solid food, and increased thirst depending on what full liquids the patient receives.

[6] This state is clinically significant due to the potential of a full liquid diet to be more efficacious in patients on dietary restriction who require a higher caloric intake. Full liquid diets are also potentially beneficial for patients suffering from dysphagia, as the texture and consistency provide less risk of penetration-aspiration; however, more research is necessary to fully understand the role of full liquid diets relative to swallowing physiology.

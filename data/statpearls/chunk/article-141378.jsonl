Open flexor sheath washout can be performed via a single extended volar incision to expose the entire flexor sheath. Two types of incisions have been described for open flexor sheath washout: a straight mid-axial incision and a zigzag incision, also known as a Bruner incision (see Figure 1. Bruner Incision Marking). [33] The involved digit's radial and ulnar neurovascular bundle should be identified and protected. After the entire exposure, the flexor sheath A1 and A5 pulleys are incised. The sheath is debrided and washed thoroughly with normal saline.

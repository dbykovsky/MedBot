Sinusoids are substitutes for capillaries in some organs such as the spleen, liver, red bone marrow, etc. and their primary function is to elicit an immune response to foreign antigens.

There are alpha-1-adrenergic receptors on arterioles of the skin, splanchnic and renal circulations, and beta-2-adrenergic receptors on skeletal muscle. Alpha1-adrenergic receptor activation results in vasoconstriction, and beta2-adrenergic receptor activation results in vasodilation. [2] Therefore, organs with predominant sympathetic innervation, velocity, and blood flow are subject to alteration by autonomic activation. Velocity (cm/sec) is blood flow (Q) over cross-sectional area. For example, blood flow is slow at the capillaries because of the high total cross-sectional area, which allows for proper nutrient exchange. Blood flow is pressure gradient over resistance or the difference between mean arterial pressure and right atrial pressure over peripheral vascular resistance. Therefore, if alpha-1 receptors become stimulated (causing vasoconstriction), the peripheral vascular resistance increases, and blood flow decreases as well as velocity.\u00a0 In contrast, if beta-2 receptors become stimulated (causing vasodilation), vascular resistance decreases, and blood flow and velocity increase. Resistance is inversely proportional to the radius of the vessel, so decreased radius increases resistance, which decreases blood flow and velocity.", "contents": "Anatomy, Blood Flow -- Structure and Function.

Other organs rely mostly on sympathetic stimulation or extrinsic control of blood flow. The coronary arteries are locally regulated by hypoxia and adenosine, which vasodilates the vessels to maintain oxygenation to the heart. When the heart increases in contractility, the oxygen demand of the coronary arteries increases. Therefore, vasodilation occurs to increase blood flow and oxygen to the arteries. The afferent arteries in the kidney are the main pressure-induced auto-regulators of renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate via stretch and tubuloglomerular feedback. Carbon dioxide is the main autoregulator in the brain that stimulates cerebral vasodilation to maintain blood flow during ischemia. [4] Astrocytes also play an important role in cerebral blood flow by mediating functional hyperemia, which states that blood flow is dependent on the amount of metabolic activity. Astrocytes release vasoactive substances depending on the oxygen state of the brain. For example, during normoxic conditions, astrocytes mediate vasodilation, and during hyperoxic states, they mediate vasoconstriction. These findings have shown that astrocyte disruption causes a lack of efficient cerebral blood flow in conditions such as Alzheimer disease and diabetic retinopathy.

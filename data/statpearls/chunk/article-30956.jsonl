The typical dosage for activated charcoal is 1 g/kg of patient weight. Do not administer to sedated patients when the airway can not be safeguarded. Since valproate comes in enteric-coated and extended-release forms that are absorbed slowly, activated charcoal may be administered after the 2-hour mark post-ingestion.

The initial dose of L-carnitine should be 100 mg/kg, administered intravenously. The treatment regimen for L-carnitine then proceeds with doses of 50 mg/kg every 8 hours. It is also essential to concurrently monitor serum ammonia levels; L-carnitine treatment may be discontinued once these levels begin to decline.

One of these is ezetimibe, which inhibits the absorption of cholesterol. Combined with statin therapy, this drug can lower LDL by 25%. Another category targets proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which regulates the LDL receptor. An increase in PSCK9 decreases LDL receptors and increases LDL levels in the blood. PCSK9 inhibitors are monoclonal antibodies that bind PCSK9 and decrease LDL levels. The new agent, inclisiran, is an interfering ribonucleic acid drug that stops the production of PCSK9 with twice-yearly dosing. [27] This agent is beneficial in patients who are intolerant of LDL-lowering medications. Icosapent ethyl is a Food and Drug Administration-approved medication that reduces cardiovascular risk in patients with elevated triglycerides in addition to maximal statin therapy. Bempedoic acid is another drug that is an option for people intolerant to statins in combination with ezetimibe. This drug works by inhibiting adenosine triphosphate citrate lyase, which increases cholesterol in the liver and decreases levels.

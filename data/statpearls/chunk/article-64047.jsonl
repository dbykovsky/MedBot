[29]", "contents": "Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes. Prudent patient selection is essential when prescribing FDA-approved THC formulations for medical purposes. Due to THC's\u00a0potential sedation and euphoria effects, healthcare providers should consider the patient's history of drug misuse or dependency and the potential for polypharmacy. Furthermore, the psychoactive effects of THC,\u00a0including hallucinations, dysphoria, and paranoia, can be distressing for certain patients. [17] [18] Consequently, a multidisciplinary and interprofessional approach, involving physicians, advanced practice practitioners, psychiatrists, addiction specialists, nursing staff, and pharmacists, is imperative when caring for these patients. This collaborative team effort is responsible for comprehensive screening to identify potential drug misuse, address adverse effects, and manage THC-induced psychiatric and medical issues.

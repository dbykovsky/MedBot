Additionally, the Act promotes the creation of state health insurance \"Exchanges\" that allow employers and individuals to select health insurance options that are eligible for federal subsidies in accordance with state and federal regulations. Subsidized plans that meet these requirements are called \"qualified health benefit plans.\" To achieve universal coverage, the Act also bars insurance companies from refusing coverage to those under 19 years of age with pre-existing conditions, prohibits cost ceilings on essential health benefits, and allows children less than 26 years of age to stay on their parents' health insurance plans. In an effort to more thoroughly integrate employers into the program and promote preventative care, the Act incentivizes the creation of \"wellness programs\" in the workplace by offering discounts, rebates, and waivers towards the cost of insurance.

{"id": "article-17275_1", "title": "Affordable Care Act -- Issues of Concern", "content": "Relevant concerns about the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act include is constitutionality, affordability, and efficaciousness. Critics of the Act insist that its \"individual mandate\" requiring citizens and legal residents to buy health insurance forces them to purchase a product they do not want, a power that does not fall under the federal government's ability to regulate interstate commerce under the Commerce Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3) of the U.S. Constitution. Another concern is that since the Act is a federal law, ensuring that the states are enforcing it would require the federal government to override state law enforcement in violation of the U.S. Constitution's 10th Amendment protection of states' rights. This, in turn, would require the states to voluntarily enforce the Act's provisions, leading proponents of the Act to fear that it will be improperly or incompletely enforced. Regulation that could potentially be ignored by state governments include prohibitions on discrimination against people with pre-existing conditions, excessive waiting periods, and requirements for internal and external impartial appeal procedures implemented when coverage is denied. [1] Other concerns include the possibility that the Act might disrupt existing healthcare coverage, force employers to curtail or abandon coverage for their employees, overwhelm healthcare providers with new patients, reduce the quality of provided services, and increase health care costs, though proponents of the law say that these concerns are exaggerated.

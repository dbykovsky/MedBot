However, physiologic jaundice should be a diagnosis of exclusion. It is of utmost importance to rule out other serious diseases as they can have disabling sequelae. As kernicterus presents with jaundice and neurologic symptoms, other diseases that cause either of the symptoms should also be considered and evaluated. A few differential diagnoses to keep in mind are: Cerebral palsy Head trauma Neonatal sepsis Congenital TORCH infections Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in the newborn Fetal alcohol syndrome Cretinism/pediatric hypothyroidism"}

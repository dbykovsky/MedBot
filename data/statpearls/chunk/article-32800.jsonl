Mallampati scoring is a system that assesses the anatomy of the mouth and the visibility of different anatomical structures in a patient when they open their mouth as wide as possible. The scoring is\u00a0typically performed in a sitting position and may not be possible in an emergency situation. The scoring ranges from classes 1-4, with class 1 indicating easy intubation and class 4 suggesting the most challenging intubation scenario.

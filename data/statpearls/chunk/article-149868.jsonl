An example of such a program would involve: a sling for four weeks with elbow, wrist, and hand exercises, plus shoulder pendular movements during this time to reduce stiffness. Following this, a progressive exercise regime is adopted, starting with gentle active movements. This should progress over 6\u00a0to 8 weeks, ultimately encouraging an active range of movement, rotation, stretching, and controlled (light) strengthening work. At the end of this period, more significant strength conditioning work can be introduced progressively. In the athlete, return to non-contact and contact sport may occur at five and six months, respectively, as a guide, but that is based on hitting the relevant functional recovery milestones. [6]"}

Acute and chronic exposure to substances of recreational use, including cocaine, marijuana, alcohol, amphetamine, and marijuana, can have significant physiological effects on pediatrics and adult. Cocaine use may lead to myocardial ischemia and infarction by causing increased myocardial demand, accelerated atherosclerosis, thrombus formation, enhanced platelet aggregation, among other cardiac and pulmonary pathologies. These patients may present to the OR in an acutely intoxicated state with significant cardiopulmonary dysfunction. General and hemodynamic stabilization is critical in these patients. Heart rate, blood pressure, and myocardial status must be optimized and stabilized."}

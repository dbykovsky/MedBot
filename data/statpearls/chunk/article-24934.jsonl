Recently, there has been increasing interest in using lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3) inhibitors as a potential treatment for metastatic melanoma. LAG-3 is a protein expressed on the surfaces of specific immune cells, including T-cells and natural killer cells. LAG-3 plays a role in regulating the immune response and can suppress T cell activation and proliferation, which can contribute to tumor immune evasion. [63] The recent phase III RELATIVITY-047 trial investigated the combination of nivolumab and relatlimab, a LAG-3 inhibitor, compared with nivolumab alone as first-line therapy for advanced melanoma. The study showed that the combination therapy significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared with nivolumab alone (10.12 months versus 4.63 months) in patients with PD-L1-negative tumors. The combination therapy also demonstrated a higher objective response rate (ORR) than nivolumab alone (58.0% versus 45.5%) in the PD-L1-negative population. However, there was no statistically significant difference in PFS or ORR in the overall population between both groups. The combination therapy was generally well-tolerated, with no new safety signals observed. [64]"}

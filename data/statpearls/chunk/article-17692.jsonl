While antimycotic pharmacology has advanced significantly, particularly in the last three decades, common invasive fungal infections still carry a high mortality rate: Candida albicans (approximately 20 to 40% mortality), Aspergillus fumigatus (approximately 50 to 90%), Cryptococcus neoformans (approximately 20 to 70%). [2] [3] Amphotericin B deoxycholate, a polyene antibiotic, was the first antimycotic agent introduced in 1958 to treat systemic mycoses. While this drug is an effective agent, the demand for other efficacious topical, oral, and intravenous was apparent. Griseofulvin was introduced in 1959, representing the second class of antifungals. The next significant introduction would not take place until 1971, when the antimetabolite drug flucytosine entered the market. Azoles first became available in 1973 with the arrival of clotrimazole; with additional azoles that have the pharmaceutical industry has rolled out over the past five decades: miconazole (1979), ketoconazole (1981), fluconazole (1990), itraconazole (1992), voriconazole (2002), posaconazole (2006), and most recently isavuconazonium (2015).

Following lipid formulations of azoles, a new class of antifungal agents that are highly effective in treating some systemic mycoses, are the recently developed echinocandins class. While the echinocandins demonstrate less renal toxicity than amphotericin B, they cause significant hepatotoxicity and are more expensive than azoles; this effectively relegates this class to second or third-line agents.

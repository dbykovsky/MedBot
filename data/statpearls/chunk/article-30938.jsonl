The differential diagnosis for vaginal cancer is diverse and can include lesions not typical of the reproductive system. Sexually transmitted infections, such as herpes simplex and syphilis, can cause lesions that can mimic cancer. Vaginal trauma and atrophy can also present with bleeding similar to vaginal cancer. Benign vaginal masses include but are not limited to polyps, Gartner duct cysts, Bartholin gland cysts, and vaginal adenosis. From an oncologic perspective, cervical and vulvar cancer must be ruled out when determining if a lesion is a primary vaginal carcinoma.

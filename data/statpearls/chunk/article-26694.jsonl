[25] The risk and side effects of specific antiarrhythmics should be considered before drug selection. Class I sodium channel blocking agents (flecainide, propafenone, disopyramide) have negative, inotropic action, and healthcare professionals\u00a0should avoid these agents in patients with a history of coronary artery disease or heart failure. Class III agents (sotalol, dofetilide) have a 3% risk of causing QT prolongation and should be initiated while in hospital. Other class III antiarrhythmic like amiodarone has greater long-term efficacy; however, over 20% of patients develop toxicities during long-term therapy. Drug therapy is most commonly used in adjunction to direct current cardioversion (DCCV). DCCV is associated with a high immediate success rate. [26] It is commonly performed in patients with hemodynamic compromise and patients with new-onset AF (fewer than 48 hours) who are candidates for rhythm control. Patients undergoing DCCV should have preexisting atrial thrombus ruled out with either transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography. Anticoagulation with warfarin 3 weeks prior and 4 weeks after DCCV\u00a0is\u00a0recommended for patients when the duration of AF is greater than 48 hours. The risk of AF recurrence post-DCCV is high and can be reduced with the use of antiarrhythmic medications. In patients with contraindication to antiarrhythmic therapy, catheter or surgical ablation can be attempted. Ablation is performed with the aim to electrically isolate the pulmonary vein (trigger foci) from the rest of the atrial myocardium. Catheter ablation is associated with high success rates (70%). No significant difference in AF burden was noted between catheter ablation and oral antiarrhythmic therapy; however, overall symptoms and quality of life were significantly better in patients receiving ablation. [27] A surgical ablation is a reasonable option for AF patients undergoing cardiac surgery for other indications. The decision to perform catheter ablation or antiarrhythmic medications used to maintain sinus rhythm is guided by patient symptoms and the risk/benefits of each therapy."}

In advanced achalasia, there may be a dilated intrathoracic esophagus with an air-fluid level. There may be a tapering of the esophagus at the lower esophagus, which gives a pathognomonic appearance of a \u201cbird beak.\u201d There may be normal anatomy in early achalasia, but the pooling of contrast will reflect the loss of peristalsis. In some instances, an epinephric diverticula may be noted immediately above the lower esophageal sphincter (LES).

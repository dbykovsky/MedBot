A clear demonstration of the surrounding structures can help decrease surgical morbidities. The 3D SPACE technique helps demonstrate a connection to the CSF space. The 3D SPACE shows signal loss in areas of CSF flow, and these areas of signal loss from flow highlight the connection\u00a0between the cyst and the CSF space.\u00a0Similarly, phase-contrast MRI can evaluate a CSF connection to an arachnoid cyst. The flowing CSF is specifically demonstrated as a signal change on phase contrast. However, secondary to false positives, a connection must be confirmed with contrast MR cisternography. [40]"}

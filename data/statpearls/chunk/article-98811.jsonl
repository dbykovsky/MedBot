The femoroacetabular joint is a ball-in-socket synovial joint and is stabilized by accessory elements that include different ligament restraints. [6] The complex biomechanics of this joint allows for a wide range of activities that include maintaining a steady gait, rising from a seated position, and adequately ambulating. [7] The ileum, pubis, and ischium constitute the pelvis. Together they form the acetabular socket, which articulates with the femoral head. At any given time, approximately 40% of the femoral head is covered by the acetabulum. [8] The labrum provides additional stability and is made up of a rim of collagen fibers. [9] The pubofemoral, ischiofemoral, and iliofemoral ligaments form the joint capsule providing additional stability to the hip joint.

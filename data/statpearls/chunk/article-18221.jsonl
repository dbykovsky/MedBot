Alcoholism and hyperthermia: The similar structure and function between benztropine and atropine as anticholinergic agents can cause anhydrosis. The administration\u00a0of benztropine in individual patients should be slow and under extreme caution. For instance, giving benztropine to patients with hyperthermia, alcoholism, who perform manual labor in a hot environment, and patients taking other atropine-like medications require extreme caution. Common signs of anhydrosis induced by benztropine are a disturbance in sweating and the development of hyperthermia. [29]"}

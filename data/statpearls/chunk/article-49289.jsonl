[1] Currently, it is listed as the most common cause of death in both men and women, accounting for 24.2% and 22.0% of all deaths, respectively, in 2016. CAD is characterized by a narrowing or blockage within the coronary arteries, often related to atherosclerosis. CAD, when significant, often results in reduced and inadequate blood flow to the myocardium leading to myocardial injury related to diminished oxygen and nutrient supply. Myocardial injury related to CAD often presents clinically as an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), including unstable angina (UA), non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). ACS is a group of conditions characterized by angina or anginal equivalents that require emergency medical evaluation and treatment.", "contents": "Instantaneous Wave-Free Ratio -- Introduction.

Iodinated contrast is then utilized to visualize the aortic valve cusps and gain access to the right and left coronary arteries. After gaining access to individual coronary arteries utilizing a variety of guidewires, angiography is performed utilizing contrast to identify significant stenosis, atherosclerotic lesions, or blockages within individual arteries. Historically, the significance of these lesions has been determined by visual approximation and estimation performed by a cardiologist trained in either diagnostic or interventional cardiac catheterization. A study published in February 2018 evaluated coronary artery lesions treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in China confirmed that physician visual assessment (PVA) of stenosis resulted in higher readings of stenosis severity when compared with quantitative coronary angiography (QCA).

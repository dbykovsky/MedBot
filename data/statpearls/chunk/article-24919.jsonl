Dystonia is defined as abnormal involuntary posturing or body movements due to sustained muscle contractions, usually happens due to neurological and medical reasons. In the early 20th century, Henry Meige, a French neurologist, had found abnormal contractions of midline facial muscles in some patients, those\u00a0he first named as \u201cspasm facial median.\u201d These patients also had a similar clinical picture in the muscles of jaw and oropharynx. Dr. George Paulson first proposed the term \u201cMeige syndrome\u201d in 1972 for patients having facial muscle spasm, particularly blepharospasm and dystonia of oromandibular muscles. After several years, the term \u201cBrueghel syndrome\u201d was introduced, used by Gilbert, for a case of jaw dystonia. It is differentiated from Meige syndrome by the absence of blepharospasm.

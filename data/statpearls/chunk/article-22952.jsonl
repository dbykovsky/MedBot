Treatment of reactive arthritis depends upon the underlying trigger and severity of the disease. In patients with a genitourinary infection, treatment with antibiotics is indicated to address the underlying cause of the infection. However, antibiotics are not recommended to treat arthritis as a stand-alone symptom. Acute reactive arthritis treatment uses maximum dose NSAIDs such as naproxen, diclofenac, or indomethacin.

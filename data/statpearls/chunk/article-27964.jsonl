The Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis initiative in 2012 was able to achieve a consensus on the features related to arthritis mutilans, which involves consideration of specific features of the disease, including digital telescoping, digital shortening, \u201cpencil-in-cup deformities,\u201d osteolysis, and involvement of distal interphalangeal joints and other small joints of the hands. [36] Features of psoriasis associated with an increased risk of axial disease include active skin lesions with induration, pustular psoriasis, nail involvement, and the Koebner phenomenon. [37]"}

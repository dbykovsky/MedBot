[31] Both types of diabetes have multifocal etiologies\u2014type\u00a01 is associated with genetic, environmental, and immunological factors and most often presents in pediatric patients, whereas type\u00a02 is associated with comorbid conditions such as obesity in addition to genetic factors and is more likely to manifest in adulthood. Type 1 diabetes results from the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic \u03b2-cells and insulin deficiency, whereas type 2 diabetes results from peripheral insulin resistance due to metabolic dysfunction, often\u00a0in the setting of obesity.\u00a0In both cases, the result is inappropriately elevated blood glucose levels, which can lead to pathology through various mechanisms."}

The prognosis has been described extensively in patients who experience CPN injury following total knee arthroplasty. In one study, 62% of patients experienced maximal neurologic recovery, and 38% had complete recovery at 12 months. [33] In another large case series study of 318 operatively-managed peroneal nerve lesions associated with various mechanisms, 84% of patients who underwent end-to-end suture repair received good recovery by 24 months.

Weakness in foot eversion may occur if the SPN is involved. Weakness in dorsiflexion of the foot and great toe extension suggests DPN involvement. Sensation in the webspace between the great and second toes is subserved by the DPN. The CPN has no motor function.

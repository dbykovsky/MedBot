[22] While neurologic outcomes worsen as the duration of hypoxia increases, the prognosis is often difficult to predict. Findings that portend a worse prognosis include absent pupillary light reflex, absent corneal reflex, myoclonus status epilepticus, and malignant EEG patterns defined as burst suppression, generalized suppression, alpha coma, post-anoxic status epilepticus, or nonreactive background. [22] Because of the difficulty in predicting favorable outcomes, guidelines recommend delaying the withdrawal of life-sustaining measures until at least 72 hours following the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).

Long term complications of undiagnosed airway foreign bodies are atelectasis, pneumonia, or bronchiectasis, occasionally requiring lobectomy or segmentectomy. It is also not uncommon for the treatment of FBAO to have deleterious side effects. Complications of the Heimlich maneuver include injury to the abdominal or thoracic viscera and regurgitation of stomach contents. For patients requiring bronchoscopy, potential complications include bleeding, infection, airway perforation, and pneumothorax. [21]", "contents": "Foreign Body Airway Obstruction -- Complications.

The gold standard diagnostic tool remains laparoscopy, combined with an exploration of the abdominal cavity and a histological biopsy. [30] The lesions can differ in size and color. They can appear as red, white, or clear vesicular. Black \"powder-burns\" or \"gunshot\" lesions have been characterized the endometriotic tissue with a brown or black color. [31] The role of histological confirmation is a bit controversial since macroscopically detected endometriotic lesions cannot always be verified histologically, and vice versa, namely in a macroscopically normal peritoneum, can be detected endometriosis tissue. [30] Direct visualization of the endometriotic lesion alone without a histological confirmation lacks enough diagnostic value since, to a great extent, it relies on the surgical skills and capability of the physician. Because diagnostic laparoscopy is an invasive procedure, it entails risks associated with any invasive process and could lead, albeit rare, to severe complications. Hence, there is a need for a diagnostic transition from surgical to non-surgical options, which could also contribute to a decrease in the time between the onset of symptoms and the diagnosis."}

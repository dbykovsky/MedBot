[5] Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine, conversely, serve as the major inhibitory neurotransmitters. GABA, for example, can account for approximately 40% of the inhibitory processing in the brain. Glycine is found primarily in the spinal cord. [6] Dopamine, another major neurotransmitter, plays an essential role in several brain functions, including learning, motor control, reward, emotion, and executive functions.

[7] Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that modulates multiple neuropsychological processes and neural activity \u2014 many drugs used in psychiatry and neurology target serotonin. Serotonin also has implications that affect gastrointestinal processes like bowel motility, bladder control, and cardiovascular function. [8] Norepinephrine is a monoamine that is synthesized in the central nervous system and sympathetic nerves. The locus coeruleus of the brain plays a vital role in the signaling of norepinephrine. The release of norepinephrine in the brain exerts effects on a variety of processes, including stress, sleep, attention, focus, and inflammation. It also plays a role in modulating the responses of the autonomic nervous system.

Specifically, calcium-evoked exocytosis of the presynaptic vesicles is what enables the release of neurotransmitters into the synapse. Active zones, specialized areas on the presynaptic plasma membranes, tether the neurotransmitter-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane. Once an action potential triggers calcium influx into the presynaptic cleft, active zones undergo fusion with the vesicles, allowing neurotransmitter release. [1] There are multiple proteins involved in the fusion of neurotransmitter-containing vesicles and the active zone. The soluble N-ethyl maleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) syntaxin-1, SNAP-25, and synaptobrevin-2 together form a SNARE complex, a key component in membrane fusion and ultimately exocytosis. A number of the proteins involved in this process may act as inhibitors and activators of the exocytosis of neurotransmitters from the presynapse.

If the mean is 140.1 mEq/L, you probably do not have convincing evidence that the numbers mentioned above are faulty (since 140 and 140.1 are\u00a0fairly close). Thus, you would fail to reject the null hypothesis. However, if your sample has a mean of 70 mEq/L,\u00a0this could be preliminary evidence (assuming, of course, rigorous methodology) and could end up rejecting the null hypothesis. The decision-making process would be trickier if the mean of the sample were 134 or 150 mEq/L. The t-test can be used to reduce subjective influence when testing a null hypothesis. Before testing a hypothesis, researchers should choose the alpha and beta values of the test. Loosely, the alpha parameter determines the threshold for false-positive results (e.g., if the actual mean serum sodium concentration is 140 mEq/L, but the t-test rejects the original hypothesis in favor of your new hypothesis), and the beta parameter determines the threshold for false-negative results (e.g., if true mean serum sodium concentration is 200 mEq/L, but the t-test fails to reject the old hypothesis).

In this case, a research question could be: do children and adults have the same mean serum sodium concentration? Testing this hypothesis would require sampling two groups, a group of adults and a group of children, and comparing the mean serum sodium concentrations between these two groups in a manner analogous to the one-sample t-test described above. The paired t-test is used in scenarios where measurements from the two groups have a link to one another. In the example above concerning the mean serum sodium concentration of children and adults, the implicit assumption was that all the measurements would all be completed at one point in time in a set of children and a distinct set of adults. However, it would also be possible to measure serum sodium concentrations in a set of children, wait a few years until they are adults, then measure the serum sodium concentrations again. Here, each adult sodium concentration corresponds to exactly one child sodium concentration. A paired two-sample t-test can be used to capture the dependence of measurements between the two groups.", "contents": "T Test -- Issues of Concern.

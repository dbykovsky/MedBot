In glaucoma, the resistance to drainage of aqueous humor most commonly starts at the inner wall of Schlemm\u2019s canal at the juxtacanalicular trabecular meshwork. The decreased outflow facility, or increased resistance to outflow of aqueous results in the gradual elevation of IOP and a characteristic damage pattern to the optic nerve ganglion cell nerve fiber layer. Another theory is that the increased IOP causes decreased blood flow to the optic nerve fibers which leads to subtle ischemic damage. Either way, POAG patients often have elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) readings that seem to correlate with characteristic optic nerve damage patterns. As the disease progresses, there is a slow loss of peripheral vision in both eyes; eventually leading to loss of central vision if left undetected or untreated.

This is because pressures can be high enough to cause glaucomatous optic nerve damage, ischemic nerve damage, or retinal vascular occlusion. [24] Patients can take medication to reduce eye pressure as quickly as possible but usually require a laser procedure called laser peripheral iridotomy. This laser creates a small hole in the iris to relieve the pupillary block, causing the pressure gradient between the posterior and anterior chambers to equalize, resolving iris bombe and opening the anterior chamber drainage angle, then the peripheral iris can be flattened with laser iridoplasty and, less commonly, with laser pupilloplasty. Decreased intraocular pressure is not necessarily a confirmation that the angle has reopened since the ciliary body can undergo ischemic damage during an attack and have decreased production for a few weeks, so it is important to have a follow up gonioscopy to ensure the angle has reopened and to comment on the percentage of the angle with peripheral anterior synechia from the acute or prior subacute attacks. [24] Once the acute crisis has been taken care of, patients are at high risk of having an attack in the contralateral eye and therefore should be considered for gonioscopy and if narrow, prophylactic iridotomy in the other eye.

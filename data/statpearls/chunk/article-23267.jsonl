Pregnant women with impaired glucose tolerance not responsive to diet or exercise should be started on insulin. Insulin does not cross the placenta, although the fetus will be exposed to maternal hyperglycemia. Since the fetal pancreatic islet cells produce insulin starting at 10 weeks gestation, the fetal pancreas is capable of responding to hyperglycemia. Upon delivery, the newborn pancreas continues to secrete insulin, although maternal hyperglycemia is withdrawn. Subsequently, the neonate\u2019s glucose will decrease, resulting in an insulin-glucose imbalance and hypoglycemia.", "contents": "Hypoglycemia -- Pearls and Other Issues. Hypoglycemia is relatively common in neonates, particularly in mothers with uncontrolled diabetes. A 2017 study performed in Israel showed that 559 neonates out of 3595 live births were observed to have a glucose level of less than 47 mg/dL. [16] Gestational glucose intolerance in the mother\u00a0is usually attributed to the presence of\u00a0human placental lactogen.

High-altitude illnesses such as HAPE may occur in isolation or concurrently with other altitude illnesses. A clinician must perform a thorough history and assessment to evaluate for other altitude illnesses such as high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE), acute mountain sickness, high-altitude headache, high-altitude syncope, and high-altitude bronchitis/cough. [14] Patients have an increased incidence of thrombosis at high altitudes, which can lead to acute cerebral vascular accidents and pulmonary emboli. Immunosuppression has been described at altitude, with an increased risk of infection and delayed healing in otherwise immunocompetent individuals."}

Recognition of early symptoms with prompt initiation of therapy is key to a mild course of illness. Attempts to continue ascent and exertion after symptom onset will lead to the progression of the disease. Even moderate to severe HAPE will improve dramatically with oxygen therapy and descent. [2] Upon arrival to a hospital, most patients will require only supplemental oxygen. It is reasonable to manage mildly affected individuals with pausing ascent, rest, and supportive care until acclimatization to altitude has occurred and symptoms have resolved fully. At this time, patients may elect to proceed with a slower, cautious ascent while monitoring for symptom recurrence. [4] Although individuals who have previously developed HAPE are prone to subsequent episodes, many can tolerate reascent at a slower pace with increased time to acclimatize. Rare long-term sequelae have been described.", "contents": "High Altitude Cardiopulmonary Diseases -- Prognosis.

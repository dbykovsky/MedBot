In patients with autoimmune inflammatory arthritis, early treatment to suppress inflammation and prevent recurrent inflammation, disease progression, and joint damage are crucial. The choice of treatment depends on the underlying etiology. Conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs such as methotrexate, leflunomide, sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine are usually first-line agents, and if lack of response, treatment with biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs shall be pursued as appropriate. [16] Close monitoring with baseline and serial laboratories is indicated in patients being treated with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.\u00a0The initial therapeutic goal is to achieve significant clinical improvement within 3 months, which may be defined as at least a 50% reduction in disease activity. [7] [17] [18] Combination therapies of conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs with other conventional or biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs are more effective and often needed to control the disease. Combination therapies of biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs are not recommended due to the increased risk of infections.\u00a0Long-term use of corticosteroids is usually not recommended, especially at moderate to high doses due to concerns\u00a0regarding adverse effects. The role of corticosteroids in managing chronic autoimmune inflammatory arthritis should ideally be limited in managing flares with has needed corticosteroid dose-tapers."}

The most common form of non-inflammatory arthritis is osteoarthritis which usually has an insidious onset and gradually worsens. Typical joints involved in primary osteoarthritis include the knees, hips, lumbar spine, 1st metatarsophalangeal joints in the feet, proximal and distal interphalangeal joints in the hands, and 1st carpometacarpal joint in the wrist. Repetitive use or injuries can lead to the involvement of other joints as well, such as the shoulders, elbows, ankles, and wrists. It can be symmetric or non-symmetric. Bony hypertrophy changes can be palpable on the exam, especially in the hands and feet. The joint can be tender and swollen, but erythema or warmth is usually absent. Synovial fluid analysis reveals noninflammatory fluid. Radiographs can show characteristic osteoarthritic changes with loss of joint space and osteophytes. Erosions are rare, but central \"gull-wing\" erosions can be seen in erosive osteoarthritis of the hands involving the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints.", "contents": "Inflammatory Arthritis -- Differential Diagnosis.

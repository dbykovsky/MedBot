Tiotropium has numerous benefits as a\u00a0maintenance therapy in patients with COPD, and it is crucial that physicians and pharmacists carefully educate patients about their medication adherence and compliance with chronic therapy, in addition to describing the adverse side effects of tiotropium. Patient education should teach patients the difference between maintenance and rescue inhaler therapies. As tiotropium is a maintenance therapy for COPD and asthma, patients must understand that tiotropium offers no rescue benefits in an acute exacerbation of COPD or bronchospasm. Physicians, pharmacists, nursing staff, and other providers should correctly demonstrate the assembling and priming of a tiotropium inhaler to patients, as this may be challenging for patients who have never used an inhaler device. A provider's ability to teach and demonstrate to a patient the proper use of the inhaler device plays a critical role in medication efficacy.", "contents": "Tiotropium -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

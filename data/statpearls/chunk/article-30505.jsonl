The first or primary lobe is drawn at a 45-degree angle from the pivot point with a similar length and diameter\u00a0to those of\u00a0the defect (some will use a slightly smaller base or slightly longer flap); when the skin is not very elastic, such as on the tip of the nose, a lobe comparable in size to the defect should be designed, but when the skin is more elastic, the lobe may only need to cover 80% of the defect's surface area. The secondary lobe is then centered at a 90-degree angle from the pivot point (45 degrees from the center of the first lobe); it should be slightly longer than the first lobe yet narrower towards the base (approximate width of the half to a full diameter of the primary lobe), and be excised with a triangular tip to create a linear scar at the tertiary defect. The width of the secondary lobe is a balance between being small enough to allow easy closure of the tertiary defect and large enough to close the primary defect site with surrounding structural displacement."}

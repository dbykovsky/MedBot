Hand-assisted laparoscopic splenectomy (HALS) combines the advantages of both open and laparoscopic techniques, enabling the surgeon's nondominant hand to be inserted through hand-assist devices to maintain pneumoperitoneum and facilitate intraoperative maneuvers. An additional incision, typically no more than 7 cm to 8 cm in length and strategically positioned near the inferior pole of the enlarged spleen, allows for easier manipulation and removal of the spleen. Despite the additional incision, HALS has been associated with fewer intraoperative complications, lower conversion rates, shorter operative times, and, consequently, shorter hospital stays compared to open splenectomy. Notably, patients with smaller spleen sizes are not typically candidates for HALS, while those with massive splenomegaly (>22 cm) can benefit greatly from this approach, which combines the benefits of minimally invasive surgery with the technical advantages of hand assistance.

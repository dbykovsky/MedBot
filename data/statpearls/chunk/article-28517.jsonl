The seropositive patients (RF-positive) with RA may experience more aggressive and erosive joint disease and extra-articular manifestations such as rheumatoid nodules and vasculitis than those who are seronegative (RF-negative).

Some patients actually\u00a0develop RF preceding the symptomatic disease. The earlier onset of RF in such patients has been associated with more severe disease. However, most asymptomatic persons with a positive RF do not progress to RA. Alternatively, there is a subset of patients in whom the appearance of RF follows symptoms. The mechanism leading to this variability is not clear. RF testing in RA patients has been reported to have a sensitivity of 60% to 90% and a specificity of 85%. Depending upon the patient and control population chosen, the sensitivity could, however, range anywhere from 26% to 90%. [9] To increase the specificity of the RA classification criteria, ACPA testing has been added. The\u00a02010 ACR/EULAR criteria for the diagnosis of RA included RF as well as ACPA. Studies have shown that sensitivities of ACPA and RF are similar, but ACPA positivity is more specific. ACPA has greater specificity than RF for early rheumatoid arthritis, therefore in addition to clinical signs and symptoms, combining the positive results of both ACPA and RF provides greater sensitivity and is more helpful in leading to diagnosis.

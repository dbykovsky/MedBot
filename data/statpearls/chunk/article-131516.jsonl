Fractures, musculoskeletal discomfort, and lower extremity malalignment such as Blount disease and slipped capital femoral epiphyses are more common in overweight than non-overweight children and adolescents. [33] Blount disease is a disorder of the proximal tibial growth plate, which results in progressive bowing of the tibia. Although the prevalence of Blount disease is low, approximately two-thirds of Blount disease patients may be obese. Slipped capital femoral epiphysis occurs due to epiphyseal plate disruption. Between 30% and 50% of patients with slipped capital femoral epiphysis are overweight."}

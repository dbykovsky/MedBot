Providers should monitor patients taking ciprofloxacin for symptoms of tendinitis, altered mental status, complete blood count, and renal and hepatic function in prolonged therapy. Other significant interactions with ciprofloxacin include theophylline (particularly concurrent caffeine use), which acts on the CYP1A2 and raises theophylline levels.

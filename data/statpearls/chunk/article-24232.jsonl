It binds to progesterone and androgen receptors, which can delay the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus. This action blunts the luteinizing hormone surge that occurs during the pre-ovulation stage. Ultimately, it can delay or inhibit ovulation by preventing fertilization via inhibiting follicular rupture and releasing a viable egg from the ovaries. Optimal efficacy is also achievable when it is taken in the pre-ovulation stage. Levonorgestrel also induces the thickening of cervical mucus, which helps by interfering with sperm motility and passage. There has been no evidence in recent studies that levonorgestrel significantly affects the endometrium to alter it to prevent pregnancy. [4]", "contents": "Levonorgestrel -- Mechanism of Action.

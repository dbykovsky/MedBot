Symptoms may include restless sleep, low energy, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, and waking up unrested.", "contents": "Central Sleep Apnea -- Deterrence and Patient Education. The patients and families need to understand the physiology and mechanism causing\u00a0sleep apnea. During regular sleep, the air can move through the respiratory tract at a normal rhythm. Still, there is the transient\u00a0cessation of air movement with resultant reduction in breathing in patients with central sleep apnea because of breathing control and rhythm changes. Central sleep apnea has a long-term impact on health and quality of life. Symptoms may include restless sleep, low energy, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, and waking up unrested."}

This may include a cardiologist in patients with heart failure to appropriately optimize treatment. The role of respiratory therapists and nurses is important in educating patients on proper techniques to use various machines and masks for non-invasive ventilation, which is a cornerstone of management in patients with central sleep apnea. Pharmacists form an integral component in evaluating and identifying any medications that may contribute to the disease progression.

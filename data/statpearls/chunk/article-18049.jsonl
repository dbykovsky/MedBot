Non-surgical management is indicated if the patient with a talar neck fracture has a strict contraindication to operative repair at this site. Moreover, genuinely nondisplaced talar neck fractures are exceptionally rare, prompting clinicians to conduct a computed tomography scan to assess the feasibility of non-operative treatment. Patients will need non-weight-bearing and immobilization if deemed appropriate for 6 to 8 weeks until the fracture healing is confirmed. However, most talar neck fractures are displaced and require surgery to reposition the bones to allow for healing. Recovery after surgery typically requires 6 to 12 weeks of non-weight-bearing and immobilization. Depending on patient risk factors, patients may be placed on anticoagulant therapy to decrease the risk of deep venous thrombosis or venous thromboembolism. Finally, after the period of non-weight-bearing ends, patients likely require a 6 to 8 week course of physical therapy.", "contents": "Talar Neck Fractures -- Postoperative and Rehabilitation Care.

{"id": "article-18049_23", "title": "Talar Neck Fractures -- Deterrence and Patient Education", "content": "Talar neck fractures account for about 50% of all fractures to the talus. These fractures are associated with a relatively high rate of avascular necrosis and posttraumatic arthritis due to the anatomical position of these fractures, technically challenging surgical approaches, and the complexity of the blood supply to the talar neck. Early recognition and management are critical in treating injuries that include hind foot pain, swelling, and ecchymosis. Recognition of these should prompt immediate presentation to an emergency department, especially in a mechanism consistent with an axial load applied across the ankle with forced dorsiflexion. Although rare, a nondisplaced talar neck fracture usually does not require surgical intervention and may be treated with immobilization for 6 to 8 weeks. However, most talar neck fractures are displaced and require surgical fixation. The inability to diagnose a displaced talar neck fracture can result in complications such as osteonecrosis, malunion, or nonunion. These complications have the potential to result in debilitating pain, loss of motion, and rigid deformity.", "contents": "Talar Neck Fractures -- Deterrence and Patient Education.

In infants and children, it is important to rule out underlying neoplasia of the sympathetic chain, especially neuroblastoma which carries a poor prognosis when diagnosed and treated late. [22] Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis may threaten vision due to complications of glaucoma. An iris melanoma may be malignant. The most common cause is benign heterochromia with no clinical significance. The other significant group of causes is congenital Horner syndrome which usually has a good prognosis. [16]"}

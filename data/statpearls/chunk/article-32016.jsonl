Since the total dose that is given for HO prophylaxis is very low, the changes of secondary malignancies are also extremely low, but not zero. There have been at least two case reports describing secondary malignancies after single fraction. The first case described a 51-year-old patient who received 7 Gy x 1 for HO 15 years earlier. He underwent a second course of 7 Gy x 1 for debilitating HO but developed high-grade undifferentiated sarcoma of the proximal thigh 16 months after his second treatment [27] . Another case described a 26-year-old male who underwent surgery for an acetabular fraction and received 7 Gy in 1 fraction postoperatively for HO prophylaxis. He presented 11 years later with osteosarcoma of the treated area, which was treated definitively with neoadjuvant cisplatin and adriamycin with plans for surgical resection at the time of the report [28] . Otherwise, there are essentially no other reported cases of secondary malignancies from RT given for HO prophylaxis treatment as it is a very rare complication."}

One study found that the rate of nonunion ranged from 12% to 30% after RT, while the rate of nonunion was diminished in 2% to 15% of the time for those who did not get RT [3] . Since modern hardware for total hip arthroplasties is cementless and porous, they may rely on bony ingrowth at the acetabulum or the proximal femur region. There is concern that RT may inhibit the necessary bony ingrowth and lead to prosthesis failure, which has prompted some providers to utilize shielding of the acetabular cup to prevent this complication. However, a clinical study of patients receiving preoperative and postoperative radiation found no evidence of prosthesis failure, even without shielding [29] .", "contents": "Radiation Therapy for Heterotopic Ossification Prophylaxis -- Radiation Oncology -- Toxicity from Radiation.

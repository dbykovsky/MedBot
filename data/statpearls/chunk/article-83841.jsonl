Complications specific to steroid use include septic arthritis, post-injection flare, local tissue atrophy, skin discoloration, tendon rupture, cartilage damage, avascular necrosis, flushing, and increased blood glucose level. If inadvertently injected intravascularly, there can be severe CNS and cardiac effects, particularly with insoluble, particulate formulations such as triamcinolone, which can embolize and lead to stroke. [18] As mentioned previously, the maximum safe dose of lidocaine in the US is 300 mg or 30 ml of 1% lidocaine.\u00a0Above this threshold, there is a risk of CNS, cardiac, and skeletal muscle toxicity. Local anesthetics have been shown to be toxic to chondrocytes in both animal studies and in vitro studies using human chondrocytes; bupivacaine is the most chondrotoxic, and ropivacaine the least. Lidocaine is most often used because it is the least expensive and most readily available. [20] [21]"}

Often the radiologist and orthopedist work together to determine the underlying cause(s) of a patient\u2019s pain. A patient will typically present initially to their primary care provider, and if clinically indicated, they may be referred to an orthopedic specialist for further evaluation. Considering the patient\u2019s history and physical exam findings, further evaluation with diagnostic imaging is sometimes indicated to evaluate for underlying pathology. It is not uncommon for imaging evaluation, such as MRI, to demonstrate multiple abnormalities, any of which could be causing the patient\u2019s pain. In these cases, it can help perform a diagnostic and sometimes therapeutic injection to help clarify the clinical significance of the imaging findings. If a patient has pain relief from a targeted injection, it can be inferred that the area treated was a pain generator.\u00a0Alternatively, if the patient does not have pain relief, one can infer that this area was not a pain generator. The patient\u2019s response is clinically important as it can guide what surgical procedures, if any, may be offered for symptomatic relief. It can also help a patient avoid unnecessary surgical procedures. Orthopedic nurses set up and assist during the procedure, provide patient instruction. Physical therapy may need to assist with post-procedure recovery exercises and strengthening the muscles around the shoulder joint. These various disciplines need to function as an interprofessional team to bring about optimal patient results from this procedure.

The ipsilateral arm is positioned at the patient's side. The thoracotomy incision is made between the second and third ribs along the superior border of the third rib. The pectoralis major and minor muscles are divided with electrocautery. Intercostal musculature is divided along the superior border of the rib in order to prevent damage to the neurovascular bundle that runs along the inferior border of the ribs. At this stage, the third rib may be detached from the sternum with an oscillating saw and moved for a better view of the operative field, or a thoracoscope may be used, allowing for the avoidance of rib resection. It is important to note that the internal mammary artery will need to be visualized and ligated to prevent hemorrhage obscuring the field of vision. In order to perform a submammary anterolateral thoracotomy, the patient will need to be positioned similarly to the supra-mammary thoracotomy position with the ipsilateral side elevated between 30 and 45 degrees and the ipsilateral arm at the patient's side. [7] A scalpel is used to sharply divide the skin along the inframammary crease overlying the fifth rib. Electrocautery is then used to divide the pectoralis major muscle and serratus anterior muscle. Visualization of the proper operative field can be achieved with the preservation and retraction of the latissimus dorsi, so it is preferable to retract instead of dividing this muscle. Either the fourth or fifth intercostal space is then entered after the division of intercostal muscles above the rib to ensure the preservation of the neurovascular bundle. To perform a posterolateral thoracotomy requires the patient to be positioned in the lateral decubitus position. Once the patient is properly secured to the operating table, the ipsilateral arm is raised and positioned anteriorly and cephalad to rest above the head. The incision is started along the inframammary crease and extended posterolaterally below the tip of the scapula. It is then extended superiorly between the spine and the edge of the scapula, a short distance. The trapezius muscle and the subcutaneous tissues are divided with electrocautery. The serratus anterior and latissimus dorsi muscles are identified and can be retracted. The intercostal muscles are then divided along the superior border of the ribs, and the thoracic cavity is accessed. Additionally, a vertical midaxillary incision may be made for muscle-sparing thoracotomy. [8] This technique involves placing the patient in the lateral decubitus position with the ipsilateral arm abducted to 90 degrees. A midaxillary vertical incision is made from just beneath the axillary hairline to approximately the ninth intercostal space, and the skin and subcutaneous tissues are divided. Dissection of the subcutaneous space continues until the posterior border of the serratus anterior, and the posterior border of the latissimus dorsi is visualized.\u00a0A retractor is used to retract the latissimus dorsi posteriorly.

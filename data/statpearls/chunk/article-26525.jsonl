The long-term impact of two to three days of acute, postoperative nociceptive pain, pales in comparison to the\u00a0centralized pain and its long-term impact on a patient's quality of life.\u00a0Part of the pain assessment is categorizing the type of pain the patient is experiencing. How the pain is described is high yield. Ask if the pain is burning or sharp and if it is constant or intermittent because the descriptors matter. Examination findings also increase the likelihood of one type of pain over another. If the patient is experiencing symptoms of allodynia or hyperalgesia, this points away from acute pain and suggests a centralized process. [46] [47]"}

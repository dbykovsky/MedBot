These risks include perinatal mortality, preterm delivery, low birth weight, cesarean section, placenta previa, placental abruption, and preeclampsia. These possible risks should also be discussed when counseling patients, but with caution, as the quality of data is limited by the existing study designs. Standardized tracking of outcomes of ART pregnancies to include these outcomes would improve the quality of evidence for or against these potential risks of IVF-conceived pregnancies. [49] [50] There is also limited evidence of a low-level increased risk of birth defects in patients undergoing IVF, particularly with ICSI, though again quality of evidence is low.

Although the role of standard radiographs is limited in abdominal imaging, abdominal radiographs can evaluate for free air, small bowel obstruction, stool burden, and abnormal calcifications(such as in the setting of obstructing ureteroliths and gallstones). [13] Abdominal radiographs can also play a role in evaluating for portal venous gas and pneumobilia as well as emphysematous cystitis and pyelonephritis. Chest and abdominal radiographs are also commonly obtained to assess the placement and positioning of various support devices such as vascular catheters, chest tubes, enteric tubes, and surgical drains."}

Standard radiographs are used to evaluate for arthritis (degenerative and inflammatory processes), bone tumors (lytic and sclerotic primary and metastatic disease), infection, and fractures. Radiography also plays an important role in mammography with its use in screening and evaluation for breast cancer. The role of fluoroscopy in interventional radiology plays an important role in the evaluation of various vascular structures (both arterial and venous) as well as the biliary system, and various cavities and spaces of the human body using contrast agents. Fluoroscopy is also used for image-guided injections of the musculoskeletal system (therapeutic and diagnostic joint injections).", "contents": "X-ray Image Acquisition -- Clinical Significance.

First, the ordering provider must decide on the appropriate imaging study to evaluate a given patient in order to establish an appropriate and accurate diagnosis. Then they must communicate the history, differential diagnosis, and requested the study to the radiology department (both technician and radiologist). Subsequently, the radiology technician must obtain the correct study, employing the correct technique at a diagnostic level, and provide the images to the radiologist in a timely fashion. Finally, the radiologist is responsible for the interpretation of the images and providing/communicating a clear, concise, and accurate report to the ordering provider. Not surprisingly this complex, multi-step process is a common issue resulting in medical errors.

Clear communication between technologists, nurses, and physicians plays an important role in obtaining diagnostic images with an adequate field of view and decreasing medical errors. A 2009 study by Verhovsek et al. determined that radiology technicians most often had trouble communicating adequately with nurses and surgeons.

This pain can be generated from heterotopic ossification at the bony amputation site, excess bony prominences, a prosthesis\u00a0with a poor fit, neuroma formation at the site of nerve transection, and insufficient soft tissue coverage of the stump site. Bony-related pain generators are caused by excessive pressure at that site and can be treated with surgical excision if necessary. Poor-fitting prostheses can cause friction between the skin and the prosthetic socket and need to be refabricated.

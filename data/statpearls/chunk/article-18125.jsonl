[13] [17] In the initial study by Bolger et al., the authors looked at both balloon-only procedures as well as \u201chybrid\u201d procedures with the Acclarent balloon device. At twelve weeks post-op, out of the original 358 ballooned sinuses, 268 were viewed under endoscopic evaluation, which revealed patency in 212, non-patency in 6 sinuses, and indeterminant patency in 50 sinuses. At 24 weeks post-op, 247 of the sinuses were patent, two were non-patent, and 55 were indeterminate. Overall, 80.5% of sinuses remained patent after BSP, compared with 1.5% classified as non-patent and 17.9% classified as indeterminate patency. Patients in this study also reported a significant decrease in SNOT-20 scores compared to preoperative scores. Of the total patients treated with BSP, subjective symptom improvement was noted by 85% of patients at week one, 98% by week 12, and 80% at week 24. The authors did note that 3 of the patients in the study did require revision surgery due to irreversible or progressed non-patency, and there was a device malfunction in 12 of the 358 sinuses. [13] The second portion of the CLEAR study by Kuhn et al. looked at 202 sinus ostia from the remaining follow up patients. They noted that 172 of 202 sinus ostia (85%) were endoscopically patent, 2 of 202 (1%) were non-patent, and 28 of 202 (14%) were indeterminate. A statistically significant difference in sinus CT scores was determined as 1.95 at one year versus 8.89 at baseline, and 1-year SNOT-20 scores (0.91) were significantly improved from baseline (2.14).

In the balloon-only patients, a statistically significant decrease in Lund-MacKay CT scores was noted, decreasing from 5.67 to 1.75 two years postoperatively.

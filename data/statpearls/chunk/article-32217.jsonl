Most physiological differences lie in variations of the pelvic girdle. There are four types classically described: The gynaecoid pelvis displays an oval shape with a wide transverse diameter. This variant is the most common type and provides adequate cavity space for a female to give birth. The android displays a heart-shaped inlet and is most common in males. The platypelloid type displays a wide inlet transversely but is short in the anterior-posterior axis. This type provides challenges for a female to give birth and is found among approximately 20% of women. [20] The anthropoid type is characterized by a wide anterior-posterior axis but is short in the transverse axis and is found in around 15% of women. [20]"}

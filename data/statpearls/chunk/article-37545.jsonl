Consequently, these drugs should be administered at least\u00a02 hours before or after levofloxacin. [24] A\u00a0study revealed that levofloxacin cross-reacts with immunoassays for\u00a02 related opioids (buprenorphine and morphine). Urine concentrations of levofloxacin consistent with therapeutic use produced results above commonly used cutoffs for positivity, highlighting the necessity of confirmatory testing. [25]"}

The gingiva is pink and non-tender, involves the attached gingiva, the gingival margin, and the interdental papillae, and has a firm and leathery consistency. Physiological states: puberty and pregnancy are associated with gingival enlargement. Scurvy: vitamin C deficiency can produce very tender bleeding gingiva. Systemic diseases: leukemia, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis - their diagnosis can be corroborated hematologically."}

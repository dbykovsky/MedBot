In severe hyperbilirubinemia, unbound, unconjugated bilirubin crosses the blood-brain barrier and binds to the brainstem, hippocampus, cerebellum, globus pallidus, and subthalamic nuclei. [2] At the cellular level, bilirubin inhibits certain mitochondrial enzymes,\u00a0interferes with DNA and protein synthesis, induces breaks in DNA strands, and hampers phosphorylation. [78] Bilirubin also impairs tyrosine uptake and alters the normal functioning of N-methyl-D-aspartate\u2013receptor ion channels. [79] [80] These mechanisms are implicated in the pathogenesis of bilirubin toxicity that clinically manifests as\u00a0bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction (BIND) and bilirubin encephalopathy. The\u00a0duration of exposure to bilirubin and the amount of bilirubin in the brain determines the severity of brain damage. However, the TSB level does not correlate well with bilirubin toxicity without hemolysis. [75] Preterm infants are more vulnerable to the toxic effects of free unconjugated bilirubin. This may be related to comparatively lower serum albumin levels, CNS immaturity, and comorbidities\u00a0such as\u00a0intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

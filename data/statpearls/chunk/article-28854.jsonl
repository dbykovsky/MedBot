High tyramine foods include aged cheese, cured meat, smoked or processed meat, pickled or fermented foods, soybeans, fava beans, dried or overripe fruits, sauces such as soy sauce, and alcoholic beverages such as homebrewed beer and red wine. Selective MAOIs such as selegiline might be less prone to this effect, but the drug's selectivity diminishes at higher doses. Nonetheless, patients still need to be counseled to avoid these tyramine-rich foods. [23]", "contents": "Selegiline -- Contraindications -- Drug-Food Interactions.

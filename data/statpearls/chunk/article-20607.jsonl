Diagnosing a patient with either condition accurately is essential because the approach to treating the 2 conditions differs significantly. Though MS is characterized by repeated attacks of neurological dysfunction separated in time and space, there is a significant overlap between the 2 conditions regarding CNS symptoms and radiographic evidence. Patients with ADEM often present with a history of prodromal viral illness, fever, neck stiffness, ataxia, impaired consciousness, and encephalopathy. In contrast, patients with MS typically do not present with these complaints. Additionally, MS is more often monosymptomatic (eg, optic neuritis alone) and has a chronic, relapsing, and remitting course.

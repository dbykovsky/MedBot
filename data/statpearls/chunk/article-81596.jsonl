[1] [2] The condition occurs secondary to unilateral agenesis or hypoplasia of the depressor anguli oris muscle.\u00a0The depressor angularis oris muscle is a triangular muscle that originates from the mandible and extends to the angle of the mouth. It is mainly innervated by two facial nerve branches, the buccal and the mandibular branch. It depresses the lower corner of the mouth and pulls it laterally. Therefore, it facilitates expressing sadness while crying. In cases of hypoplasia/agenesis of the depressor angularis oris muscle, no mouth/lip movement is seen on the hypoplasia side while the corner of the mouth is pulled downwards on the normal side.

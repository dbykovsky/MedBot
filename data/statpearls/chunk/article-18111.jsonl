The tongue often falls to the back of the pharynx which can occlude the airway. The appropriate head tilt, chin lift maneuver or a jaw thrust helps to keep the airway open. The \"sniffing\" position is achieved with forward flexion of the neck and equilibrating the sternal notch and angle of the mandible. An oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal may be utilized to maintain an open airway. Not only does the sniffing position assist with opening the airway as needed, but it can also help visualize the glottis opening as well as the vocal cords, improving your ability for first pass success during endotracheal intubation. Many BVMs are augmented by a one-way valve or a pressure valve. They require an oxygen supply to adequately deliver oxygen to the patient.

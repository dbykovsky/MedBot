MDT is based on the observation that fly larvae only debride dead, devitalized, and necrotic tissue. Healthy, viable tissue is not threatened during the MDT, making this therapy uniquely suited for debridement of devitalized tissues with truly surgical precision [48] . In fact, MDT is considered a form of \"biosurgery.\" While feeding on non-viable tissue, maggots secrete proteolytic enzymes that liquefy necrotic tissue within the wound. This liquefied material is then ingested, resulting in effective debridement of the tissue of interest. It has been shown that MDT can help debride large wounds in as little as 72 hours, resulting in a viable granulation bed that is suitable for conventional wound management. In addition to chemical debridement, larval secretions are also characterized by significant antimicrobial activity, active against a wide range of pathogenic (and often antibiotic-resistant) bacteria, mostly gram-positive species.

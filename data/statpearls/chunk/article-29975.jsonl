As a polypeptide folds into its correct shape, amino acids with nonpolar side chains usually cluster at the core of the protein, staying away from water. Once the nonpolar amino acids have formed the nonpolar core of the protein, weak van der Waals forces stabilize the protein. Furthermore, hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions between the polar, charged amino acids contribute to the tertiary structure. These are all weak interactions in the cellular environment, but their cumulative effect helps give proteins their unique shape. Disulfide bridges, covalent bonds formed between\u00a02 cysteine residues, further reinforce the shape of a protein. Disulfide bridges form when the sulfhydryl groups of\u00a02 cysteine residues come into close contact because of protein folding. Covalent bonds are not a weak interaction.", "contents": "Biochemistry, Tertiary Protein Structure -- Fundamentals.

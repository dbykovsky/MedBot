Sensorineural hearing loss will affect a large part of the population at some point in their lifetime. It is essential to\u00a0manage these patients with an interprofessional team, including primary care doctors, otolaryngologists, neuroradiologists, and audiologists. In the pediatric hearing loss, it is vital to diagnose these patients early to avoid long-term effects on their development. In patients with syndromic hearing loss, the other symptoms may be quite severe, and managing them together with the pediatric team is crucial.\u00a0SNHL can have a significant psychosocial impact on a patient; thus, the patient and family require ongoing support in the community to minimize the impact on daily living activities."}

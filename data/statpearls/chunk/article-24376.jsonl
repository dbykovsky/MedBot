Jaundice is often a sign of altered bilirubin metabolism.\u00a0The first sign of jaundice is often yellowing under the tongue, followed by scleral icterus (yellowing of the sclera). There are numerous causes for jaundice, which can typically be classified by getting a fractionated bilirubin where indirect bilirubin (unconjugated bilirubin) and direct bilirubin (conjugated bilirubin) are measured. The result of the fractionated bilirubin can help identify the etiology of the cholestasis into prehepatic and intrahepatic or extrahepatic causes."}

Causes of intrahepatic cholestasis can be congenital diseases, such as Gilbert syndrome and Crigler-Najjar syndrome. In these congenital diseases, the enzyme responsible for bilirubin conjugation, UGT, is mildly deficient or completely\u00a0deficient. Dubin-Johnson and Rotor syndrome are causes of direct bilirubinemia as there is a defect in canalicular transport of conjugated bilirubin. Other causes of post-hepatic cholestasis are an obstruction, such as due to a stone or malignancy. Viral hepatitis can result in both indirect and direct hyperbilirubinemia.

Hepatitis viruses A and E lead to acute hepatitis without resulting in chronic hepatitis, although hepatitis E can lead to fulminant hepatitis in pregnant patients. Hepatitis A and E\u00a0are typically seen in travelers and from contaminated water or seafood sources. They are usually self-limiting illnesses that present with jaundice and vomiting.

It can either occur at the same time as hepatitis B, called coinfection or on top of hepatitis B, called superinfection. The distinction is important as superinfection can lead to more severe disease. Hepatitis B and C can both occur from contaminated needles, as in tattoos, intravenous drug use, or iatrogenically. [13] Hepatitis B can also be sexually transmitted. The best prevention for hepatitis A and B is vaccination, and IgG is a marker that shows vaccination or prior exposure, whereas IgM shows acute infection.

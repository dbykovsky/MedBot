A lateral foot drop is more characteristic of superficial peroneal nerve damage, which weakens the muscles that evert the foot.\u00a0Walking is accompanied by dragging of the foot's lateral margin. Complete common peroneal nerve injuries or concurrent deep and superficial peroneal nerve damage produces both anterior and lateral foot drop. Foot drop\u00a0may\u00a0manifest during pregnancy and parturition when the fetal head\u00a0compresses the lumbosacral trunk (L4, L5) during the 3rd trimester. [20] [21]"}

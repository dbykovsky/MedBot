The skin is shiny and hard to the touch. A woody consistency is typical. Papules and subcutaneous nodules can also be seen. The skin can have a peau d'orange appearance, and plaques may have an amoeboid advancing edge. Joint involvement usually results in disability and contractures. Yellow scleral plaques have been reported. The fibrosis may also involve the renal tubules, lungs, dura mater, ocular sclera, and skeletal and cardiac muscles. [1] If the lungs are affected, the mortality rate increases, particularly if the diaphragm is involved. [10] The face is almost always spared. Yellow-colored palmar papules that appear as cutaneous calcinosis have been noted. Additionally, some reports suggest the appearance of yellow scleral plaques in patients with NSF."}

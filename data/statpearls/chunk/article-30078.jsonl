Still, the most common injuries due to thoracic trauma are pneumothorax and hemothorax, which are definitively managed in 80% of cases with tube thoracostomy. The size of the\u00a0chest tube used is a clinical decision based on the pathology seen on a chest x-ray. If both pneumothorax and hemothorax are present, a size 28-Fr or 32-Fr chest tube is usually considered\u00a0as this will facilitate the evacuation of both air and blood\u00a0while minimizing the chance of the tube obstructing due to clot. If no effusion is present, small-bore catheters are appropriate, although many trauma clinicians will still opt for formal chest tubes instead. Occult pneumothorax is a pneumothorax that is seen on CT but not on a chest x-ray. They are incidentally found in 2 to 10% of trauma patients who undergo chest CT. Patients can be observed if the pneumothorax is less than 8 mm. [8] However, occult pneumothoraces\u00a0are associated with a 5% to 10% risk of expansion and should, therefore,\u00a0be monitored closely. Patients whose pneumothoraces expand or those who become symptomatic warrant tube thoracostomy."}

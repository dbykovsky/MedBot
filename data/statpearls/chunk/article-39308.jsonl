Massive transfusion can cause TRALI [18] [19] \u2014a rapid-onset lung injury leading to non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. TRALI type I manifests in patients without additional risk factors for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, TRALI type II occurs in patients with ARDS risk factors or those who already have ARDS but experience acute decompensation due to transfusion. Approximately 85% of cases result from the infusion of antibodies targeting human leukocyte antigen (HLA) or antineutrophil antibodies present in the donor blood products. The remaining 15% of cases likely originate from biological response modifiers, for instance, soluble CD40 ligand, within the stored blood product."}

Unlike TRALI, TACO presents with visible neck vein distention, an S3 heart sound, and hypertension. This condition also responds well to diuresis and exhibits a pulmonary artery occlusion pressure exceeding 18 mm Hg. TACO develops when there is an overly aggressive transfusion or the administration of an excessive volume within a short time frame. [20] Both TRALI and TACO typically occur within 6 hours of a transfusion. Patients with TRALI clinically resemble those with ARDS, presenting with a PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio of less than 300 mm Hg but greater than 200 mm Hg, bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray, and no signs of systolic heart failure. If symptoms occur in the 12 hours\u00a0before the transfusion or more than 6 hours after a transfusion, then ARDS is the appropriate diagnosis.", "contents": "Massive Transfusion -- Complications -- Transfusion-Associated Circulatory Overload\u00a0(TACO).

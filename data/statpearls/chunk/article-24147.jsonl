There are five stages of lung development, listed in sequential order: embryonic (3\u00a0to 7 weeks), pseudo glandular (5\u00a0to 17 weeks), canalicular (16\u00a0to 26 weeks), saccular (26\u00a0to 36 weeks), and alveolar (32 weeks through childhood). The major maturation of the fetal lungs occurs during the alveolar stage when the maturation of type II pneumocytes occurs. Type II pneumocytes are responsible for the production of surfactant, which is critical for the support of alveoli in the lungs to combat surface tension.", "contents": "Lecithin Sphingomyelin Ratio -- Introduction.

Due to the drug's potential for various toxicities, having a comprehensive medical history centered on renal, otological, and neurological conditions is imperative before considering a neomycin prescription.\u00a0Patients should be well-informed about the advantages and potential risks of neomycin therapy. Furthermore, conducting baseline and regular laboratory assessments is essential to monitor for any indications of end-organ damage in patients. The recommended course of action for patients receiving neomycin is as follows: Physicians and\u00a0advanced practice practitioners usually prescribe the medicine. The internist is responsible for determining the appropriate indication for neomycin in hepatic coma. The surgeon is responsible for identifying the proper indication of neomycin in surgical prophylaxis. A nephrologist consultation is necessary if the patient develops nephrotoxicity."}

[72] Signs and symptoms of acute dacryocystitis include erythema, swelling, warmth, tenderness of the lacrimal sac, and purulent discharge. Approximately 10% of children with NLDO may develop anisometropia, with or without amblyopia. [73] In rare cases, lacrimal fistulas can form in the presence of chronic inflammation. [74] Other potential complications include scarring of the nasolacrimal duct following surgical intervention, adverse reactions to anesthesia, and infections resulting from the surgical procedure."}

Neoplasms, trauma, radiation, chemotherapy, mechanical obstruction, and inflammation can cause acquired NLDO. The primary symptom in all patients with dacryostenosis is epiphora or watery eyes. Healthcare professionals should educate patients and caregivers about the normal lacrimal drainage process, followed by a detailed discussion of the patient's level of obstruction. Although clinical diagnosis is often sufficient for newborns and infants, adults may require additional diagnostic tests such as dacryocystography, dacryoscintigraphy, CT, MRI, and nasal endoscopy for a more comprehensive evaluation of the condition.", "contents": "Dacryostenosis -- Deterrence and Patient Education.

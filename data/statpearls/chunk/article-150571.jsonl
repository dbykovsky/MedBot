Dumping syndrome occurs when food passes rapidly through the stomach and enters the small intestine without complete digestion. This leads to gastrointestinal and vasomotor symptoms, including fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and hypotension. Hypotension can result from a rapid osmotic fluid shift from the plasma into the bowel, potentially causing tachycardia and syncope. Patients can often alleviate their symptoms through appropriate adjustments in diet and lifestyle. [34]", "contents": "Bariatric Surgery Cardiac Outcomes -- Other Issues -- Dumping Syndrome.

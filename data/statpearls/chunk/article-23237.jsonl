Regardless, increased apo B concentration is seen and is used to distinguish from familial hypertriglyceridemia. It is associated with premature cardiovascular disease. [7] Familial hypertriglyceridemia is more common and is associated with the secretion of large VLDL particles, typically with low LDL and HDL. There is increased VLDL production and decreased VLDL catabolism, resulting in saturation of lipoprotein Lipase. It has an autosomal dominant inheritance. It is usually not associated with the premature cardiovascular disease unless the TGL levels are very high but can present with pancreatitis. [7] Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia (type III hyperlipoproteinemia) is due to defective Apo E. It is characterized by the build-up of chylomicrons and VLDL remnants. Elevation in both cholesterol and triglycerides and roughly similar levels should raise suspicion for this syndrome. It is associated with premature cardiovascular disease and peripheral vascular disease. [7]"}

Non-HDL cholesterol levels should be calculated if triglycerides are more than 200 mg/dL, as hypertriglyceridemia is associated with atherogenic triglyceride-rich particles. Initiate therapy if the triglyceride level is greater than 200 mg/dL. Pancreatitis risk increases if triglyceride levels are more than 500 mg/dL, then dramatically rises if more than 1500-2000 mg/dL.

Weight loss of 5% to 10% is associated with a reduction of triglyceride levels. Similarly, regular aerobic exercise can reduce triglycerides. The amount of decrease in triglycerides due to exercise and dietary modifications is usually variable. [15] Many studies have shown that monounsaturated fatty acid-rich Mediterranean-type diet has reduced postprandial lipemia. When triglyceride levels are in excess of 500 mg/dL, restriction of dietary fat is key to avoid a postprandial rise in chylomicrons and thereby reduce the risk of pancreatitis.", "contents": "Hypertriglyceridemia -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

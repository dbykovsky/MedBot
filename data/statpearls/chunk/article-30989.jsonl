What is known is that inflammation plays a central role in the development and progression of the disease.

This sets off a feed-forward cycle of venous wall remodeling and local inflammation. It is believed that high venous pressures cause shear stress, which is sensed by the endothelial cells. In response, growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor, and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) are released and stimulate vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation.

Progression of the disease involves further VEGF and TGF-beta 1 mediated vascular remodeling with increased leukocyte infiltration.

The theory behind venous ablation is using heat to damage the vein wall, which causes fibrosis and collapse of the vein. LASER, which stands for \u201clight amplification by stimulated emission of radiation,\u201d is a device that focuses light energy. For endovenous laser ablation, a fiber optic laser is inserted into the vein and, when activated, will transmit light energy to the laser tip that is distributed radially by a prism and will heat the surrounding tissue. [10] Heat injury to the vein wall will cause disruption to collagen, leading to fibrosis and collapse of the vessel. Tumescent anesthesia, which plays a critical role in this procedure, is given prior to ablation to decrease intravenous blood volume through venous compression, create a barrier between laser and surrounding tissue, and provide local anesthesia. The procedure can be performed in an outpatient setting and does not require general anesthesia.

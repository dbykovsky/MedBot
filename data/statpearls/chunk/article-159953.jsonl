Primary care clinicians, internists, and infectious disease (ID) specialists\u00a0are critical in accurately diagnosing a bacterial infection, ensuring the administration of cefuroxime, and determining the appropriate indication, dosage, and duration of therapy. They also monitor for potential adverse drug effects and evaluate the response to treatment. Nurse practitioners and physician assistants can closely monitor patients for possible adverse drug reactions. Clinical pharmacists contribute by educating patients on medication details, administration, possible side effects, and potential drug interactions. Patients actively participate in their management by regularly updating clinicians and nurses about their experiences and overall well-being during the course of treatment. This collaborative approach ensures comprehensive care and optimal outcomes."}

The main specialties seeking consultations included cardiology, orthopedics, general medicine, hematology-oncology, gastroenterology, and pulmonary or critical care. The primary reason for seeking consultations was to select antibiotics, which accounted for 75% of cases. The study found that consultations with ID specialists significantly reduced inappropriate antimicrobial therapy and dual therapy use, emphasizing the crucial role of ID physicians in optimizing treatment plans. [50] The implementation of antimicrobial stewardship programs is essential to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, including cephalosporins such as cefuroxime. [13] However, emergency department care for severe bacterial infections should not be withheld. When a bacterial infection is suspected, it is advisable to begin treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Subsequently, based on clinical improvement and microbiological results, antibiotic therapy can be refined to a more targeted or narrower spectrum.

A retrospective study highlighted additional clinical factors such as prematurity, total bypass minutes, and ECMO use contributing to attrition, defined as death or heart transplant. [19] Certain anatomic subtypes may also pose risks post-Norwood procedure, although generalization across institutions is challenging. [20] [21] Furthermore, research suggests that full-term patients with aortic atresia may exhibit improved survival with a Sano shunt, whereas preterm subjects may fare better with an mBTT shunt.

[3] Interstage mortality, encompassing mortality between all\u00a03 stages, is highest after the first-stage Norwood procedure. However, before Norwood pioneered his strategy, all neonates born with HLHS faced imminent death. [1] His groundbreaking work initiated the paradigm shift towards staged palliation for neonates with otherwise fatal congenital heart disease. This innovative approach has since facilitated palliative surgery for thousands of neonates, enabling them to reach adolescence and adulthood, with many ultimately undergoing cardiac transplantation.", "contents": "Norwood Procedure -- Clinical Significance.

Physicians, advanced practice providers, nurses, pharmacists, respiratory therapists, echocardiographers, and other health professionals are crucial in delivering patient-centered care throughout the perioperative period, ideally beginning during the fetal period. Physicians are responsible for assessing patient eligibility for the Norwood procedure, meticulous surgical execution, and postoperative care. Advanced practitioners, such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners, provide invaluable support in perioperative care, including preoperative evaluation, intraoperative assistance, and postoperative monitoring. Nurses are integral members of the care team, overseeing patient assessments, administering medications, monitoring vital signs, and providing essential patient education and emotional support to families. Pharmacists ensure appropriate medication management, including sedation, pain control, and maintenance of hemodynamic stability.", "contents": "Norwood Procedure -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

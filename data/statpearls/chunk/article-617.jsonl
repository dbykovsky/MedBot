Aortic valve repair procedures are being increasingly performed in patients with tricuspid aortic valves but also with bicuspid aortic valves with a slight difference in surgical techniques. In addition to providing the opportunity to repair the subvalvular and supravalvular apparatus including aortic root repair, they also provide the unique opportunity of repairing/remodeling the native valve.

High volume centers with adequate expertise seem to a pre-requisite to gain procedural and long-term success. To derive good outcomes, the goals and objective of the aortic valve repair have to be defined prior to taking the patient to surgery. In some cases, a complication may necessitate further re-operation, thus requiring close coordination with the critical care teams for adequate patient recovery. As with any other complex procedure, the preoperative workup must be thorough, and the patient should be seen by a pulmonologist and cardiologist to optimize lung and cardiac function. Because of the potential risk of injury to the native valve, an intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), and a postoperative TEE monitoring is required.", "contents": "Aortic Valve Repair -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

The nurses will assist the team by monitoring the patient for pain, bleeding, worsening of breathing, and a variety of common postoperative complications such as atelectasis, deep vein thrombosis, ileus, and pain. The pharmacist may be involved in preoperative and intraoperative medication reconciliation. The procedural success is dependent on close coordination between physicians, nurses, and pharmacists in in-patient and outpatient settings to detect both early and delayed complications and addressing them on time. Thus, further emphasizing the need for an interprofessional approach to the management of aortic insufficiency. The need for meticulous planning and discussion with other professionals involved in the management of the patient is highly recommended to lower the morbidity and improve outcomes.

The condition presents various signs and symptoms, such as wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness.\u00a0Wheezing may not always be present, particularly in cases primarily affecting small airways, and its absence does not exclude asthma. Additionally, a cough might be the sole symptom, especially one that occurs or worsens at night. Diagnostic evaluation involves spirometry, assessing lung function parameters such as FEV1 and FVC, measuring peak flow, and possibly conducting bronchoprovocation testing in some individuals.", "contents": "Asthma -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

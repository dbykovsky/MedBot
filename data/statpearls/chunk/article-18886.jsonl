{"id": "article-18886_2", "title": "Cardiac Dominance -- Issues of Concern", "content": "As with any coronary artery, the posterior descending artery is subject to possible stenosis or occlusion secondary to atheromatous plaque accumulation or thrombosis. The result of stenosis to the posterior descending artery would be decreased perfusion or even infarction of the posterior third of the interventricular septum, depending on the severity. Therefore, the location of the possible infarction or reduced perfusion depends on the individual's cardiac dominance. For example, a patient who is left-heart dominant and suffering from severe stenosis of the proximal left main coronary artery may suffer infarction of the posterior interventricular septum. However, this would not be true in a patient with codominant coronary circulation. A stenotic lesion to the proximal left main coronary artery would decrease perfusion to the posterior interventricular septum. However, it would still receive blood via the right coronary artery, reducing the risk of an infarct.", "contents": "Cardiac Dominance -- Issues of Concern.

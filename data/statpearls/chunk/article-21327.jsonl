Surgical procedures are divided accordingly to the anatomical position of esophageal cancer. Cervical esophageal cancer usually requires resection of portions of the larynx, pharynx, thyroid, and proximal esophagus with lower esophagus preservation. Thoracic esophageal cancer will include a total esophagectomy (cervical esophagogastrostomy) with radical two-field lymph node dissection and jejunostomy feeding tube placement. EGJ cancer will involve total esophagectomy and partial or extended gastrectomy. Thoracic cancer resection for the middle to lower esophagus can be divided into three major techniques in the United States: transhiatal, transthoracic (Ivor-Lewis), and tri-incisional esophagectomy. Esophagectomy guidelines recommend at least 15 lymph node resection for adequate staging, and this leads to s significant reduction in mortality (5-year disease-specific survival; 55% less than 11 nodes were resected, 66% for 11 to 17 nodes resected, and 75% more than 18 nodes resected). A positive circumferential resection margin has higher overall mortality compared to the negative (OR 4.02, 2.25 to 7.20, p < 0.001). Reported surgery mortality rates should be less than 5%, and a 5-year survival rate\u00a0ranges from 5% to 34%. Thoracic, minimally invasive esophagectomy with abdominal laparoscopic intervention offers a surgical recovery advantage with promising better oncologic outcomes over an open thoracotomy and abdominal laparotomy procedure with an experienced surgeon at a center of excellence. Patients\u2019 nutritional status on esophageal cancer complicated by dysphagia before and after surgery should be monitored and should be palliated with esophageal stents, lasers therapy, endoscopic dilation, and gastric/jejunal feeding tube when necessary and feasible."}

The vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 monoclonal antibody ramucirumab dosed at 8\u00a0mg/kg intravenously (IV) every 2 weeks\u00a0showed a modest survival benefit of 9.6 months when combined with paclitaxel versus paclitaxel alone dosed at 80\u00a0mg/m\u00a0on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle alone (7.4 months), RAINBOW trial.\u00a0 Ramucirumab also showed a modest survival benefit in the REGARD trial when used as a single agent (5.2 months) versus best supportive care (3.8 months). The two trials mentioned above were both phase III clinical trials in patients with advanced gastroesophageal cancers who progressed first-line chemotherapy on a fluoropyrimidine and platinum agent. Other second-line targeted therapy agents with clinical improvement in survival outcomes in clinical trials are apatinib (an oral VEGFR-2 inhibitor with a median of 6.5 versus 4.7 months with placebo), regorafenib (an oral multikinase inhibitor with a median of 5.8 versus 4.5 months with placebo). Bevacizumab, sunitinib, sorafenib, aflibercept, gefitinib, and everolimus had no significant overall survival benefit with other secondary outcome improvements. A clinical trial selected patients with low expression of ataxia telangiectasia protein had a significant survival benefit from paclitaxel plus olaparib (an oral active poly-ADP ribose polymerase inhibitor) with mOS not reached compared to paclitaxel plus placebo of 8.2 months, and a phase III trial is ongoing. A 2017 study hypothesized that microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) and deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) tumors might be susceptible to immune checkpoint inhibition. The frequency of dMMR or MSI-H has been reported as high as 7% for esophageal/GEJ\u00a0adenocarcinoma. Eighty-six selected dMMR patients with 12 different tumor types (including refractory advanced or metastatic esophageal carcinoma) who received pembrolizumab achieved 53% objective response and 21% complete response, with subsequent FDA approval for all solid tumors with those characteristics.

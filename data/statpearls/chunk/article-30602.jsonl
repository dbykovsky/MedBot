The condition often presents as a severe headache on one side of the head that affects the territory of the affected trigeminal nerve branch, occurring in short intervals, often multiple times within the same day. These headaches may be accompanied by autonomic symptoms such as nasal congestion, swelling, and lacrimation on the affected side. The cause of cluster headaches is currently unknown. However, an identifiable external stimulus often triggers the onset of symptoms. Prophylactic treatment usually includes a combination of trigger avoidance and pharmacotherapy. Acute attacks may be remediated with fast-acting triptans and oxygen."}

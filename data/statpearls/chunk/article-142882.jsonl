The outcomes of ASSR testing in children are influenced by various factors, including the\u00a0ambient noise levels, with higher noise associated with smaller amplitudes, recording time, with longer durations reducing residual noise in the electroencephalogram and aiding the recognition of near-threshold responses, and the signal-to-noise ratio, which compares response amplitude in ASSR to background EEG amplitude. Infants typically exhibit smaller ASSR response amplitudes than adults, necessitating noise reduction and stringent criteria for detection. The age of the infant also plays a role, as ASSR results are less\u00a0reliable in younger infants and exhibit greater variability; ASSR is\u00a0more effective when conducted on healthy, full-term infants older than\u00a02 weeks of age.

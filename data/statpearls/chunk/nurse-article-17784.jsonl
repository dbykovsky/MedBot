This is a small, finger-like, hollow organ located\u00a0at the tip of the cecum portion of the large intestines, usually in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen.

Appendicitis is one of the most common causes of acute abdominal surgery and typically occurs between ages 5 and 45, but can occur at any age, with men having a slightly higher risk. Appendicitis is most\u00a0often a disease of acute presentation, usually within 24 hours, but it can also present as a more\u00a0chronic condition. If there has been a perforation with a contained abscess, then the presenting symptoms can have a slower and less painful onset. The exact function of the appendix has been a debated topic. Today it is accepted that this organ may have an immunoprotective function and acts as a lymphoid organ, especially in the younger person. Other theories contend that the appendix acts as a storage vessel for \"good\" colonic bacteria. Still, others argue that it is a mear developmental\u00a0remnant\u00a0and has no real function.

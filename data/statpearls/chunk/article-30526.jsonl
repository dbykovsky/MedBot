However, after it had failed as a nasal decongestant, it was found to be an effective antidepressant. Monoamine oxidase is the enzyme that degrades neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. There are two types of monoamine oxidase, MAOA and MAOB. MAOA breaks down serotonin and norepinephrine and is found\u00a0mainly in the gut. MAOB metabolizes phenylethylamine and is present in high concentrations in the basal ganglia and platelets. Both MAOA and MAOB break down dopamine. This drug is mostly a nonhydrazine irreversible inhibitor of MAOA and is also an irreversible inhibitor of MAOB, but to a lesser degree. Tranylcypromine also blocks the reuptake of catecholamines and serotonin. As a result, the levels of norepinephrine, epinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine increase. Tranylcypromine is also structurally similar to amphetamine, which may contribute to why this drug has some stimulant-like effects. The onset of action for this drug is typically 2 to 4 weeks, and the duration is approximately 10 to 21 days. [6] [7]", "contents": "Tranylcypromine -- Mechanism of Action.

This medication is less likely to cause weight gain in patients, and some patients may even experience weight loss. This MAOI risks hypertensive crisis, especially if it interacts with other sympathomimetics. Hypertensive crisis, severe increases in diastolic blood pressure of more than 120 mm Hg, will first present with an occipital headache followed by confusion, chest pain, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, palpitations, anxiety, or seizures. A special diet limited in tyramine is an absolute necessity for patients taking an MAOI to avoid a hypertensive crisis. When the MAOIs inactivate the MAO enzymes, the norepinephrine release by tyramine cannot be properly broken down either, potentially resulting in high circulating levels of norepinephrine in the blood. High blood levels of norepinephrine released by tyramine can lead to dangerous levels of increased blood pressure.

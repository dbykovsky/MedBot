As monocanalicular tubes often contain a phalange stabilizing one end within the punctum, prolapse is rare. It is potentially possible for the patient to remove the tube with vigorous eye rubbing. If the punctum is large such as following a\u00a0previous punctoplasty, the stent may become dislodged into the canaliculus, but migration may also occur spontaneously in children."}

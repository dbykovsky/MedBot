Simple asphyxiants such as carbon dioxide and methane cause hypoxia by displacing oxygen in the lungs and lowering inspiratory oxygen concentrations. Chemical irritants such as hydrochloric acid, ammonia, and formaldehyde interact directly with mucous membranes and cause direct injury to the eyes and respiratory tract. Furthermore, physical exposure to heat causes direct thermal mucosal injury, and the deposition of particulate matter, such as soot\u00a0or debris, may impair proper gas exchange in the alveoli. Lastly, chemical asphyxiants such as carbon monoxide (CO) and cyanide (CN) produce systemic ischemia and metabolic acidosis by interfering with mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.", "contents": "EMS Asphyxiation And Other\u00a0Gas And Fire Hazards -- Introduction.

Bone scintigraphy is sensitive for detecting bone remodeling, periostitis, and microfractures associated with bone stress injury. [30] These changes result in increased uptake on bone scintigraphy before changes can be seen on radiographs. Stress fractures of the tibia, metatarsals, the scaphoid, tarsal bones, and spine are the more common indications for a bone scan. Although MRI is the most common modality used to diagnose tibial stress fractures and is comparable to bone scintigraphy sensitivity, bone scintigraphy can provide prognostic information by determining whether active bone turnover is present at the fracture site.

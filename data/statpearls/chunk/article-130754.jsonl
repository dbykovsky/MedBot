Some studies have demonstrated an increased risk of spontaneous abortions, increased infertility, and having children with congenital anomalies. Long-term exposure to volatile anesthetics possibly predisposes anesthesiologists to multiple organ system dysfunctions. The modern anesthesia machine incorporates a gas scavenging system to capture volatile anesthetics to minimize exposure to volatile anesthetics. The scavenging system gathers exhaled volatile gases from the anesthesia equipment. It transports them away from the operating room, likely into the atmosphere and outside the building, housing the anesthesia machine. Most anesthesia machines utilize an open system that sits over the exhaust port and adjustable pressure limiting valve of the anesthesia machine. The scavenging system gathers gases into a reservoir then utilizes the pipeline suction to transport the reservoir gases outside of the operating room. Positive and negative pressure relief valves are utilized to prevent the transmission of scavenged gases into the breathing circuit.

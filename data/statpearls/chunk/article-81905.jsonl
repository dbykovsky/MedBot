[7] While avoiding flap formation and preserving biomechanical strength, surface ablation with MMC is associated with increased postoperative pain and slower visual recovery. [32] Thin-flap LASIK, though easy to perform with minimal postoperative pain, poses a risk of flap-related complications, and its efficacy and safety in SMILE retreatment lacks extensive data. Some authors have\u00a0suggested that thin-flap LASIK\u00a0may be suitable only for patients with\u00a0cap thickness over 135 \u00b5m and low refractive error. [32] Lastly, the CIRCLE approach, where the SMILE cap converts into a full flap, offers minimal pain and\u00a0rapid recovery\u00a0with significant data to support its efficacy and safety; however, this method carries the risk of flap-related complications and is relatively difficult to perform.

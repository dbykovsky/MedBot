The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a boxed warning for JAK inhibitors, cautioning about the risk of severe infections, mortality, malignancy, major adverse cardiovascular events, and thrombosis. Initial dosing is 2 mg/d with an increase to 4 mg/d if the response is inadequate after 3 months. Patients with severe symptoms may start at the 4 mg/d dose. Upon achieving an adequate response, clinicians reduce the dose to 2 mg. Therapy is discontinued if no improvement is observed after 6 months."}

Due to its secretion from different tissues, it is a non-specific marker and is, therefore, more valuable in monitoring response to therapy and prognosis than diagnosis. Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in men worldwide. A specific form of AP, sensitive to tartrate inhibition, called secretory prostatic acid phosphatase, is normally secreted by prostate tissue. However, cancerous prostate tissue tends to overexpress it. In fact, 95% of patients with prostate cancer have high levels of AP, especially if metastasized to bones. Therefore, it was the major serum marker for prostate cancer used in screening and staging but has recently been replaced with a more specific marker, the prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Nonetheless, prostatic acid phosphatase measurement is still being used in forensic cases as it is actively released in seminal fluid and can be used to identify seminal fluid in law enforcement cases.

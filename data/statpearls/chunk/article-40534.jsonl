Nail plate biopsy\u00a0followed by Periodic Acid Schiff stain may be useful in the diagnosis of onychomycosis (fungal nail infection) with a negative mycological examination. Nail biopsy may also be an option in inflammatory (like lichen planus) or tumoral changes. Polarized light microscopy is done if anomalies of the hair shaft are suspected.\u00a0Clinicians typically use dermoscopy (trichoscopy) in the clinical setting. [14] [15]"}

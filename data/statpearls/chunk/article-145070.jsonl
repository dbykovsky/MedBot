The spherical equivalent method is used when the optometrist and ophthalmologist deal with patients that probably cannot tolerate lenses with a cylindric lens correction. Spherical corrected lenses may not provide the best corrected visual acuity. However, they can provide enhanced vision without problems related to toric lenses. The clinician needs to decide when to use this method for prescribing lenses based on the special needs of each individual patient and consider pertinent indications and contraindications on a case-to-case basis."}

In such cases, patients gain more quality care from a multifaceted assessment. The timely adoption of an interprofessional approach is critical for these individuals. People with diabetes with poor glucose control regimens, for example, may be first seen by the optometrist or ophthalmologist with complaints of transient blurry vision. These individuals may require multiple changes to spectacle prescription without timely referral to endocrinology for the underlying metabolic disorder.", "contents": "The Spherical Equivalent -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

One theory introduced by Eller in 1746 is that ganglion cysts are the result of the herniation of synovial tissue from joints. Another theory postulated by Carp and Stout in 1926, which forms the basis of most modern belief, suggests that ganglion cysts result from mucinous degeneration of connective tissue secondary to chronic damage. Currently, most authors agree that ganglion cysts arise from mesenchymal cells at the synovial capsular junction as a result of the continuous micro-injury. Repetitive injury to the supporting capsular and ligamentous structures appears to stimulate fibroblasts to produce hyaluronic acid, which accumulates to produce the mucin \"jelly-like\" material commonly found in ganglion cysts.

[58] Major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder are the most common comorbid conditions related to chronic pain. There are twice as many prescriptions for opioids prescribed each year to patients with underlying pain and a comorbid psychiatric disorder compared to patients without such comorbidity. [39] Intuitively, this makes sense. For example, a patient suffering from depression often complains of fatigue, sleep changes, loss of appetite, and decreased activity. These symptoms can make their pain worse over time. It is also crucial to realize patients with chronic pain are at an increased risk for suicide and suicidal ideation. [24] [25]"}

Thus chronic pain is best managed with an interprofessional approach.\u00a0Managing chronic pain requires an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals that includes a primary care physician, nursing team, pharmacist, and pain medicine specialists. Without proper management, the patient's quality of life can have a deleterious impact.\u00a0 The evaluation and treatment of such patients are paramount but in order to avoid drug diversion and misuse, health professionals must work as a team."}

Instruction for post-operative care for patients are: Wear loose clothing that does not irritate the wound Do not soak in the bathtub, hot tub, or swimming pool soon after surgery Clean incision with soap and water every day after wound epithelialization occurs Change wound dressings frequently Avoid any lotions, creams or herbal remedies on the wound A gradual return to activity is advised As most patients are in the older age group, physiotherapy and occupational therapy may be advised.", "contents": "Mycotic Aneurysm -- Deterrence and Patient Education.

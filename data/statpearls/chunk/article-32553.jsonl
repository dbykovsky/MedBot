[19] Therefore, it merits noting that an intact hyoid does not always rule out strangulation as the underlying cause of death. The hyoid is fractured more commonly in the older victims of strangulation and is less likely to occur in younger victims of strangulation in the age group 20 to 40. [19] The differences in the age-related frequency of hyoid fracture are dependent on the degree of ankylosis of the hyoid that progresses with age. The mobility in the region of the junction between the greater horns and the body of the hyoid should not be mistaken for a fracture.", "contents": "Anatomy, Head and Neck: Hyoid Bone -- Other Issues -- Forensic Significance of Hyoid Fracture. The damage commonly affects the greater horns or the region between the body of the hyoid and the horns. Injuries are mainly in the form of vertical or oblique fractures. Displacements of the fracture segments are also observed. Bilateral fractures of the hyoid and double fractures of one of the greater horns are not uncommon. [18] The frequency of\u00a0a fractured hyoid is higher in cases of strangulation in comparison to cases of hanging. However, a hyoid fracture is present in only about a third of all homicides from strangulation. [19] Therefore, it merits noting that an intact hyoid does not always rule out strangulation as the underlying cause of death.

{"id": "article-22137_5", "title": "Genetics, Epigenetic Mechanism -- Cellular", "content": "The second epigenetic mechanism is post-translational modifications to histone proteins. These modifications include enzyme-catalyzed acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitylation, each of which alters the DNA-histone interactions in nucleosomes. [16] Histone acetylation often occurs at positively charged lysine residues which weakens the DNA-histone interactions, thus opening the chromatin and facilitating transcription. [17] For example, acetylation of lysine 9 and lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K9ac and H3K27ac, respectively) correlates with transcription activation. Histone methylation is more complex as it does not change the histone protein charge and can include the addition of 1-3 methyl groups to lysine and 1-2 methyl groups to arginine. [17] For example, methylation of lysine 4 on histone 3 (H3K4me) is associated with transcription activation while trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K27me3) correlates with transcription repression. [18] Histone phosphorylation involves the addition of a negative phosphate group to the histone tail, but less is known of its function aside from phosphorylation of H2A(X) playing a role in the response to DNA damage and its subsequent repair.

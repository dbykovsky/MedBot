Key facts regarding hyperuricemia are listed below. Most patients with gout are not on optimal doses of their uric acid-lowering medications. [75] Many patients will need higher doses than the typical 300 mg daily to achieve optimal serum levels of 6 mg/dL or less. [75] Allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome is a rare but potentially fatal reaction. [59] African Americans and individuals of Chinese, Korean, and Thai ancestry should be tested for the HLA-B*58:01 allele, which predisposes them to this dangerous hypersensitivity reaction, before starting allopurinol therapy. [79] Allopurinol should be avoided in those who test positive for this gene. Patients with chronic kidney disease are also at higher risk. [78] [80] In these patients, use low doses of allopurinol initially and gradually titrate upwards only every 2-4 weeks. [80]"}

Another priority is the development of a paratyphoid vaccine. While the Ty21a vaccine may provide some cross-coverage against S Paratyphi B, no vaccine is currently sufficiently effective for controlling S Paratyphi infection; this is particularly concerning in South and Southeast Asia, where S Paratyphi is most prevalent. Paratyphi may also increase proportionally as Typhoid vaccination increases."}

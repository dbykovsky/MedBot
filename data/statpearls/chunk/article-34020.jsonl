The particular nerve that is injured is identifiable by understanding the\u00a0sensory distribution of the cervical plexus.", "contents": "Anatomy, Head and Neck, Posterior Cervical Region -- Clinical Significance. Another point of clinical relevance involving the posterior cervical region is an injury to the nerves of the posterior triangle. Injury to the accessory nerve can result in difficulty shrugging the shoulder or elevating the arm above the head because the trapezius muscle is compromised. If the accessory nerve suffers damage within the posterior triangle, the sternocleidomastoid muscle is spared because the accessory nerve already gives its motor branches to this muscle more proximally. [18] The cutaneous branches of the cervical plexus are also susceptible to injury from both trauma and iatrogenic causes and can result in sensory deficits over the cervical region. The particular nerve that is injured is identifiable by understanding the\u00a0sensory distribution of the cervical plexus."}

After the confirmatory blood sample is obtained, treatment doses of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid should be initiated in all infants in whom CAH is a consideration, to prevent the potentially life-threatening manifestations of an adrenal crisis. If the physician chooses not to initiate treatment while awaiting confirmatory steroid hormone measurements, serum electrolytes should be measured daily. A pediatric endocrinologist should manage these patients."}

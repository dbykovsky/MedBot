[36] Consequently, renal vasodilatation leads to an increase in systemic volume and Na retention. This rise in venous blood volume and pressure, along with resulting distension of the vessels, led to stasis and increased lower extremity edema. [37] However, it has been proposed that, unlike VTE in the general population, VTE in pregnancy may start in the pelvis [38] rather than the lower extremities, as the percentage of isolated pelvic deep venous thrombosis is significantly higher in pregnancy. There are also circulating cytokines and growth factors that may contribute to the breakdown of the endothelial monolayer.

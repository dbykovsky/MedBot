Tungsten is often the usual anode target, although other material targets are also employed.

There are three important types of interactions that occur between X-rays and the tissues of our body. The \u201cclassical\u201d or \u201ccoherent\u201d interaction occurs when an X-ray strikes an orbital electron and subsequently bounces off and changes direction. [6] These X-rays are low energy\u00a0and do not cause ionization and only add a small dose amount to a patient. In \u201cCompton\u201d scattering, X-rays of higher energy strike an outer shell electron and are strong enough to remove it from the shell, causing ionization of an atom. [7] This phenomenon contributes to dose and also contributes to scatter. Photoelectric interactions occur when an incoming X-ray strikes an inner shell electron, removing it from the shell and causing a downward cascade of outer shell electrons filling inner orbit vacancies, further releasing secondary X-rays. This type of\u00a0interaction contributes to image contrast. Finally, the differential absorption of X-rays within the tissues of the body subsequently contributes to the production of the final image. Attenuation of X-rays ultimately depends on the effective atomic number in tissue, X-ray beam energy, and tissue density. [8]", "contents": "X-ray Production -- Definition/Introduction.

Generally\u00a0speaking, various procedures entail different effective radiation doses based on site and use of contrast. For example, a radiograph of the spine has an approximate effective dose of around 1 mSv. [10] A radiograph of the extremity ranges within the upper limits of normal between 0.17 to 2.7 microSv. [10] To better place these doses in context, we can compare these exposures with natural radiation we obtain from our surroundings, which usually approximates to 3 mSv per year. [11] A spine X-ray, therefore, is comparable to the natural background radiation exposure for six months. An extremity radiograph compares to natural background radiation exposure of 3 hours. Bone densitometry and mammography studies have an approximate effective dose of around 0.001 mSv and 0.4 mSv, respectively, comparable to 3 hours and six weeks of background radiation,\u00a0respectively.

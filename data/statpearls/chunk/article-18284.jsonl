Biliverdin decreases inflammation by downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TLR-4 and by stimulating the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10.

The nitrosylated biliverdin reductase is then thought to translocate to the nucleus and bind to TLR-4, decreasing the expression of this pro-inflammatory cytokine. Researchers surmise that biliverdin increases the production of IL-10 due to the phosphorylation of biliverdin reductase when biliverdin binds to this enzyme on the surface of macrophages. When biliverdin reductase is phosphorylated, it can bind to PI3K, which then activates Akt. This activation of Akt leads to the increased production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10.

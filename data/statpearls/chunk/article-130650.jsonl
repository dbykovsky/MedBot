Cyanoacrylate (CYA) glue is a class of synthetic glue mixed with lipiodol, an oily contrast agent before injection into varix that rapidly polymerizes into a hard-acrylic plastic upon exposure to water or blood, leading to hemostasis. [24] Current American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) guidelines recommend an evaluation with diagnostic endoscopy and treatment of gastric variceal hemorrhage with gastric variceal obturation (GVO) with the employment of a cyanoacrylate-based compound for the treatment of acute gastric variceal hemorrhage by endoscopists familiar with this technique. Otherwise, endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) is recommended, especially GOV1 and small GOV2. [26] A meta-analysis study by Qiao et al. reported higher rate of active bleeding control (OR, 4.44; 95% CI, 1.14-17.30;P =0.032) ,lower rebleeding rate (OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.18- 0.60; P =0.0004) and lower gastric varices recurrence rate (RR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.11-0.61; P =0.002) in patients treated with cyanoacrylate injection compared to patients who were treated with EVL.

The benefit of the EUS guided approach is that it precisely identifies the actual degree of variceal obliteration. A single-center retrospective study involving 152 patients with high-risk gastric fundal varices treated with EUS-guided combined coil and CYA glue injection reported that the combination therapy was highly effective for hemostasis in active bleeding and also when used for primary and secondary bleeding prophylaxis of gastric varices. A multicenter meta-analysis by McCarty et al. concluded that EUS-guided therapies were safe, effective, and technically feasible for the treatment of GV. This study also noted that among different types of EUS-guided therapies, EUS combination therapy with coil embolization + CYA injection is a preferred approach for managing GV over EUS-based monotherapy (coil alone or CYA alone).

It is the treatment of choice in acute gastric variceal bleeding, especially GOV2 and IGV1. Randomized control trials have shown that TIPS has been more effective than cyanoacrylate injection in preventing rebleeding from gastric varices, with similar survival rates and frequency of associated complications.

BRTO is an invasive technique that involves the retrograde injection of a sclerosing agent into gastric varix after occluding the portosystemic shunt with an occlusion balloon under fluoroscopic guidance.

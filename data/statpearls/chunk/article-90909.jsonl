It is a cardiotonic glycoside and belongs to the digitalis class. The chemical formula of digoxin is C41 H64 O14. Cardiac glycosides, including digitalis and digoxin, have long-standing use in clinical practice. This drug received approval from the FDA in 1954 and is used to treat various heart problems such as atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure with its associated symptoms and to induce fetal demise prior to an abortion. Superior therapies with milder adverse effects and better safety profiles, such as beta-blockers and calcium-channel blockers, have replaced it. In current practice, it is reserved as a backup drug when first-line agents are ineffective. Its optimal use is in the treatment of mild to moderate heart failure in adult patients and to increase myocardial contraction.", "contents": "Digoxin -- Indications.

Cardiac output increases with a subsequent decrease in ventricular filling pressures. [2] AV node inhibition: Digoxin has vagomimetic effects on the AV node. By stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system, it slows electrical conduction in the atrioventricular node, therefore decreasing the heart rate. The rise in calcium levels leads to the prolongation of phase 4 and phase 0 of the cardiac action potential, thus increasing the AV node's refractory period. Slower conduction through the AV node carries a decreased ventricular response. [2]", "contents": "Digoxin -- Mechanism of Action.

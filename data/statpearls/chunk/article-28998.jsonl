Multiple types of shoulder labral injuries can occur in different patient populations. One particularly common injury subgroup includes young athletes afflicted with a traumatic shoulder dislocation. In the setting of glenohumeral instability, clinicians should recognize the importance of not only a recurrent dislocation but the risk of increased bone loss and soft tissue compromise, which may ultimately affect the outcome following surgical repair."}

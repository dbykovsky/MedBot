The etiology and pathogenesis of synucleinopathies are\u00a0complex with proposed interactions between gene transcription and expression and environmental insults that lead to cellular dysfunction in vulnerable neurons in the central nervous system. Dysfunctional regulation, processing, cleavage, and degradation of abnormal cytoskeletal and endovesical (Golgi and endovascular reticulum) proteins within the cells are thought to interfere with\u00a0mitochondrial dynamics, membrane integrity,\u00a0proteosome, and lysosomal pathways. Genetic susceptibility may determine susceptibility, for example, free radicals\u00a0generated through disruption of\u00a0complex I activity, increasing the nuclear or mitochondrial genomic deficit. Environmental interactions\u00a0factors such as the metabolism of exogenous drugs can generate endogenous neurotoxins\u00a0that can also trigger the generation of reactive oxygen species that disrupt calcium homeostasis and trigger cell death.\u00a0 Neuronal pathways are susceptible to oxidative processes, and therefore,\u00a0become a prime target to these insults. Specifically, reactive oxygen species can trigger excitotoxicity by increasing glutamate in the synapses, triggering neuroinflammatory microglial processes, and most likely, a combination of all these complex processes. Interestingly, Lewy bodies\u00a0are like other aggregated proteins such as neurofibrillary tangles (NFT)\u00a0in AD\u00a0and/or Pick bodies in terms of being present as markers of neurodegenerative processes. What exact\u00a0analogous mechanism they have in common to disturb cellular activity is complex\u00a0and is currently\u00a0under investigation. [27] [28] [29] [30]"}

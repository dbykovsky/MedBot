The rotator cuff interval is a region located\u00a0between the supraspinatus and the subscapularis tendons. The structure and function of this interval underwent a study by Jost et al.\u00a0and were found to be comprised of the supraspinatus and subscapularis and the coracohumeral ligament, superior glenohumeral ligament, and the glenohumeral joint capsule. [13] The interval was divisible into the 2-layer medial part, which was found to limit inferior translation, and the 4-layer lateral portion, subdivided into the 3-layer fibrous plate and a 1-layer lateral part, which mainly limits external rotation when the arm is adducted. The coracohumeral ligament component of the interval was found to be the key structure in the rotator cuff interval. It plays a vital role in both external rotation, inferior translation, and stability of the glenohumeral joint. The rotator cuff interval and its function in restricting movement is an important surgical consideration. Closure of the lateral part of the interval restricts the resultant external rotation range of the adducted joint. Hence, the performance of the closure should be in an externally rotated position to allow for appropriate functional return. Also, superior migration of the humerus due to rotator cuff tear or insufficiency may require the release of the medial coracohumeral ligament to keep the humeral head centrally located\u00a0in the fossa."}

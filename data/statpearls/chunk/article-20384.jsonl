Some lesions may even undergo spontaneous regression, resulting in hypopigmented skin. Most dermatofibromas remain stable for years without significant changes. With thorough excision, these lesions rarely recur, and only the most aggressive variants show local recurrence in approximately 20% of patients. Consequently, in excisional biopsies involving cellular or atypical variants, re-excision may be recommended to ensure clear margins due to the documented, albeit low, rate of local recurrence. Although extremely rare, metastases have been reported. [3] [27] [28]"}

The circadian system is an endogenous cycle entrained by external cues, most importantly\u00a0light. The circadian rhythm can be measured by\u00a0evaluating\u00a0melatonin levels, cortisol levels, and core body temperature. Structurally, the circadian rhythm exists within the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus. The suprachiasmatic nuclei receive direct information on illumination from ganglion cells in the retina. Ganglion cells contain a photopigment called melanopsin and transmit signals to the suprachiasmatic nuclei through the retinohypothalamic tract. The suprachiasmatic nuclei then process this information and stimulate the pineal gland to release melatonin. Melatonin increases in the evening in response to dim light and peaks around 3 hours before waking. Melatonin receptors are found primarily in the retina, the pars tuberalis of the pituitary gland, and the suprachiasmatic nuclei. This feedback onto the suprachiasmatic nuclei serves as a feedback mechanism that supports the circadian rhythm.", "contents": "Sleeplessness and Circadian Disorder -- Etiology.

It should be considered in obese patients with symptoms of GERD who prefer surgical therapy [27] [29] [36] [29] [27] . Current ACG guidelines recommend performing preoperative ambulatory pH monitoring in patients without erosive esophagitis and esophageal manometry to rule out achalasia or undiagnosed scleroderma-like esophagus prior to surgical therapy [29] . Two large meta-analyses comparing medical therapy with surgical therapy reported contrary conclusions with one reporting improvement of symptoms of GERD after surgery compared with medical therapy and the other reporting considerable uncertainty in the benefits of surgical therapy compared to medical therapy [37] [37] [37] . However, patients undergoing fundoplication are at risk for developing postoperative adverse events that include bloating, which is seen in 15 to 20% of patients, dysphagia, and belching. The most common bariatric surgeries performed are Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), laparoscopic adjustable gastric banded plication (LAGP), and sleeve gastrectomy [36] . Studies have shown that the resulting weight loss from surgical management of obesity has had positive effects on GERD.

Most of them were discontinued after failing to demonstrate long-term efficacy.

A recent meta-analysis by Gerson et al. that included data from 233 patients demonstrated that subjects who underwent TIF 2.0 procedure had improved esophageal pH, decreased need for PPIs, and significant improvement in the quality of life at three years after TIF 2.0 procedure [38] . Another prospective study by Testoni et al. demonstrated TIF with EsophyX as an effective long-term treatment option for patients with symptomatic GERD with associated hiatal hernia less than 2 cm. A meta-analysis comparing Nissen fundoplication and magnetic sphincter augmentation that included data from 688 patients with 415 who underwent MSA and the rest who were treated with Nissen fundoplication concluded that MSA was an effective therapeutic option for GERD as short-term outcomes with magnetic sphincter augmentation appeared to be comparable to Nissen fundoplication [39] .", "contents": "Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease -- Treatment / Management -- Endoluminal Therapy.

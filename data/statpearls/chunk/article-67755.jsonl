Some bone lesions have a characteristic or pathognomic appearance on radiographs, and further imaging is not indicated, such as non-ossifying fibroma (NOF). As previously described, advanced imaging such as CT and MRI better evaluates the extent of disease (i.e., joint or soft tissue involvement) as well as better characterization of the lesion, thereby narrowing the differential diagnosis and allowing for the determination of indication for tissue sampling. CT and MRI also aides in surgical and biopsy planning.", "contents": "Wrist Imaging -- Clinical Significance.

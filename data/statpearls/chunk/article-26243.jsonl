Targeted therapies focusing on the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway have become more prevalent, emphasizing the importance of tumor biopsies. The most common genetic aberration is a BRAF-KIAA1549 proto-oncogene fusion, which activates the MEK/MAPK/ERK and mTOR pathways and causes cell proliferation, survival, and tumorigenesis. MEK inhibitors such as selumetinib, trametinib, and refametinib target this pathway and report a 69% 2-year progression-free survival for refractory optic pathway gliomas.

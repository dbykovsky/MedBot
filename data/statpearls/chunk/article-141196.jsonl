[49] For patients with moderately elevated hemoglobin A1C levels and established cardiac or renal disease, SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1RA should be added to metformin therapy before adding insulin or other agents due to their documented efficacy in improving cardiovascular mortality and slowing the progressive renal disease. In patients with a risk of hypoglycemia, GLP-1RA, SGLT2 inhibitors, and\u00a0dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are the treatment of choice as they do not increase the risk of hypoglycemia as opposed to insulin."}

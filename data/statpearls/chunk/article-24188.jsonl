[70] We would encourage readers to refer to that resource for an in-depth discussion. The stages are briefly summarized below: Stage I \u2013 Low-risk primary melanomas (T1a, T1b, T2a) without evidence of regional or distant metastases. Stage II \u2013 Primary melanomas that are at higher risk of recurrence (T2b, T3a, T3b, T4a, T4b), but without evidence of regional or distant metastases. Stage III \u2013 Involvement of regional lymph nodes or the presence of in-transit or satellite metastases. Stage IV \u2013 Distant metastases present."}

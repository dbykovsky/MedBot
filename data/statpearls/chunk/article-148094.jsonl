Research findings indicate that the\u00a0combination\u00a0of dexamethasone and acetaminophen can be notably effective in reducing APR, especially myalgia. [26] The risk of APR may be influenced by the underlying indication for which treatment was initiated. [24] [25] APR is thought to be mediated by high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. A study on patients receiving treatment for aromatase inhibitor-associated osteoporosis noted that APR was around 70%. A large study looking at APR after using zoledronate in women with post-menopausal osteoporosis revealed the incidence to be approximately 40%. [27] [28]"}

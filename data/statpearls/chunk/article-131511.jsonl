It relates to diet during hunting and gathering lifestyle.\u00a0There was no single paleolithic diet as it varied according to geographical region based on climate and food availability. [33] This difference accounts for the varied composition of macronutrients and the source, whether from plant or animal sources. The paleolithic diet included the primary source of energy from plant-based food. It consisted of whole foods, fruits, nuts, seeds, legumes, vegetables, and protein and fat from meat and fish. The carbohydrate consumed was low glycemic and rich in high fiber content. [34] The paleolithic diet did not have any food processing except heating of the food. The significant difference between the paleolithic diet and the modern diet is that the paleolithic diet did not include cereal grains, dairy, and ultra-processing of food. Paleolithic diet has gained considerable attention and popularity in current culture."}

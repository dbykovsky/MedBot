Its blood supply includes superior and inferior ulnar collateral artery branches. The ulnar collateral ligament originates at the medial epicondyle and has an important function of stabilizing the elbow during valgus stress.\u00a0The ulnar nerve also runs posteriorly along the groove of the medial epicondyle. The medial epicondyle is the final ossification center to ossify in the elbow. Children can have an open apophysis until age 14 or 15, thus making the medial epicondyle more susceptible to injury.

The BRAF gene codes for the protein that is involved in the signaling pathway and cell growth.", "contents": "Physiology, Thyroid -- Clinical Significance. The MCT8 gene is highly expressed in the brain and is responsible for expressing the iodine transporter in the cell membrane that brings iodine into the cell. MCT8 -specific thyroid hormone cell-membrane transporter deficiency is X-linked recessive; thus mostly occurs in males and is diagnosed by high serum 3,3\u2019,5-triiodothyronine (T3) concentration and low serum 3,3\u2019,5\u2019 triiodothyronine (reverse T3 or rT3) concentration.

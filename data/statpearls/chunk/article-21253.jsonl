[1] The general idea is to make a controlled incision in the perineum, for enlargement of the vaginal orifice, to facilitate difficult deliveries. Ideally, an episiotomy would relieve pressure on the perineum resulting in an easily repairable incision when compared to uncontrolled vaginal trauma. The different types of episiotomy incisions include the midline, the modified-median, the mediolateral, J-shaped, lateral, anterior, and radical. [2] [3] The two most common techniques are midline (the US and Canada) and mediolateral (Europe). In the United States, episiotomy was once a widely used technique until 2006 when the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) made a recommendation against its routine use. However, the selective use of episiotomy still has utility and should be performed based on clinical judgment and maternal or fetal indications.

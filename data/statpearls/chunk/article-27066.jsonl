Other interfering factors include high blood glucose levels in diabetics; caffeine, alcohol, or tobacco within 24 hours of the procedure; excessive anxiety, which affects brain function; medicines like insulin, tranquilizers, and sedatives; and neurological or psychiatric conditions, which prevent the ability to lie still.", "contents": "PET Scanning -- Interfering Factors. Strenuous exercises can lead to a considerable increase in radiotracer uptake by various tissues & hence, should be avoided before imaging. [39] Twenty-four hours before the scan, a low-carbohydrate, no-sugar diet is advised. Allowable foods include meat, cheese, eggs, and vegetables\u00a0without starch. Cereals, pasta, milk, bread, and sugar are not allowed. Six hours before the scan, not eating or drinking anything is recommended. Metal may interfere; hence, it is preferably removed. Other interfering factors include high blood glucose levels in diabetics; caffeine, alcohol, or tobacco within 24 hours of the procedure; excessive anxiety, which affects brain function; medicines like insulin, tranquilizers, and sedatives; and neurological or psychiatric conditions, which prevent the ability to lie still."}

Potential side effects of radiation, as they hold for other imaging modalities, are also seen in PET scans. In a standard PET scan, the amount of radiation is less, in the range of 8 mSv, about equivalent to that received from natural sources like the sun. PET-CT uses higher levels of radiation in the range of 24mSv. Pregnant ladies shouldn\u2019t undergo a PET scan unless necessary, as radioactivity can affect the fetus. A breastfeeding woman should limit close contact with infants or pregnant women for up to 12 hours. Breast milk may be discarded until 12 hours & after about 24 hours, it is considered safe to breastfeed again.", "contents": "PET Scanning -- Patient Safety and Education.

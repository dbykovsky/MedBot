Given the established process for identifying, differentiating, and diagnosing conditions based on the presence or absence of MDBs, further inclusion or exclusion criteria could refine the diagnostic process. Though the molecular basis is elucidated, several downstream effects of epigenetics, proteasome regulation, TLR signaling, and immunomodulation are unknown, though the aggregations resemble several protein-aggregating diseases. The role of MDBs in lesser-known reproductive or pulmonary diseases could be explored."}

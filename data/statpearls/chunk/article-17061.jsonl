Accessory spleens are a relatively common phenomenon with an estimated 10% to 30% of the population having one. Typically, an individual can have anywhere from one to six accessory splenic buds. Furthermore, the size of an accessory spleen can also vary. Most accessory spleens are approximately 1 centimeter, but it is not uncommon to find accessory spleens larger than a few centimeters. [1] Accessory spleens typically form due to developmental anomalies and are often confused with splenosis which is another form of ectopic splenic tissue. Splenosis arises from trauma which results in a portion of the spleen breaking off and embedding itself somewhere else in the peritoneal cavity. The newly embedded ectopic splenic tissue recruits local blood supply and becomes functional splenic tissue. An accessory spleen can be distinguished from splenosis since an accessory spleen is functionally and histologically similar to normal splenic tissue,\u00a0but splenosis is missing key splenic characteristics such as a thick capsule, smooth muscle elements, and a blood supply arising from the splenic artery.

Accessory splenic tissue can develop along the path from the midline that the spleen takes during development, or follow the path of gonad descent. Around the fifth week of development, a primitive spleen begins to form from the mesoderm of the dorsal mesogastrium. The dorsal mesogastrium initially is midline with the foregut but during early development rotates to the left side as the foregut begins to take a rounder shape. After the dorsal mesocardium rotates around the foregut, the mesenchymal tissue from the dorsal\u00a0mesocardium which gives rise to the spleen migrates over to its predetermined location approximately\u00a0between\u00a0what will become the ninth and eleventh ribs. If mesenchymal buds moving away from the midline path do not fuse\u00a0together,\u00a0then accessory spleens can form. An accessory spleen, however, can also be formed by the descent of the gonads during development. The spleen initially forms near the urogenital ridge, the site of gonad development. Due to their proximity during development, the gonads can become fused to splenic tissue. The gonads, as they develop, descend through the abdomen. If the gonads fuse\u00a0with the spleen, they can forcibly drag splenic tissue with them in their descent.

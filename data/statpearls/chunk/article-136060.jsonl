Letrozole is an aromatase inhibitor and is used for ovulation induction. The main advantage of Letrozole is that it is a reversible enzyme inhibitor. It blocks the conversion of androgen to estrogen and thus increases the level of testosterone. It is used in a dose of 2.5 to 5 mg orally from day 2\u00a0or 3 of the cycle for five days. Its half-life is about 30 to 60 hours. Because of this short half-life of 4\u00a0to 5 hours, it is an ideal ovulation-inducing agent. Indication for its use is in clomiphene citrate resistant cases, PCOS patients, poor responders, endometriosis, an older woman, and breast cancer patients. Its major advantage over clomiphene citrate is that it has no anti-estrogenic effect on the endometrium and cervical mucus. It reduces multiple pregnancy rates and decreases the chance of OHSS. The use of letrozole has been recently increased in anovulatory infertility in comparison to clomiphene citrate. [10] [9] The major adverse effects are vasomotor symptoms such as hot flashes, nausea, and fatigue. [11] It is contraindicated in women with the risk of osteoporosis, endometrial hyperplasia, and endometrial neoplasia."}

Consistent, stable sesamoid bones like the patella allow\u00a0the lower extremities to offload forces for our ambulation and support greater weight. Without the patella, instability of the knee joint, reduced range of motion, and difficulty straightening the leg would be common problems.

[29] The study showed that musicians tended to have greater sesamoid bone volume within the hand; an unusually shaped sesamoid is more prevalent in female musicians. A musician's repetitive use of their hands and the subsequent increase in the sesamoid bone volume show that the body constantly adapts to the various stressors faced. Sesamoid bones play a crucial role in the body, allowing for everyday actions many take for granted.

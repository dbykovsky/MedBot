Nonpharmacologic treatment approaches are strongly recommended with moderate-quality evidence. [1] The first is to induce a refractory period by performing 10 to 15 minutes of vigorous activity, decreasing EIB for the next 2 hours. However, high or low-intensity exercise does not induce the refractory period. [1] [20] The refractory period is theorized to occur due to an increase in bronchodilating PGE2 and/or desensitization to bronchoconstriction mediators. [9] [20]"}

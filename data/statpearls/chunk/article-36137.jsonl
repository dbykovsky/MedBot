While compartment syndrome is typically diagnosed clinically, depending on the cognitive status of the patient, a measurement of the intra-compartmental pressure can provide a diagnosis. If the difference between the diastolic blood pressure and the intra-compartmental pressure is 30 mm Hg or less, urgent open fasciotomy and revascularization are required. [20] If acute compartment syndrome is untreated, nerve ischemia will result in 30 minutes and irreversible damage results after 12 hours. Loss of muscle function will begin in the initial 4 hours, and irreversible muscle damage ensues\u00a0over the next 6 to 12 hours. [18]"}

Surgical intervention can be utilized for Mild contractures, however, is required for Moderate and Severe contractures. Surgical intervention consists of tendon lengthening, muscle slides, and free functional muscle transfers.

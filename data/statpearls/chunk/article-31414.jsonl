[1] Persistent injury to the nerve from repetitive actions to the radial nerve with prolonged use of crutches or extensive leaning on the elbows can also lead to a wrist drop. Mechanical derangement of the radial nerve need not involve compression. It can also involve enlargement, torsion, and fascicular entwinement. [2] Lead poisoning and thiamin deficiency (beriberi) may also result in wrist drop. [3] Wrist drop may also be a presenting sign of a more systemic neuromuscular disorder, such as limb-onset amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Radial head entrapment can be proximal to the elbow at the head of the triceps muscle, in which case a deficit in elbow extension may accompany the wrist drop.

Falk et al. were the first to describe and name LCA in 1991. Most of the reported cases are that of benign tumors and can present as a single lesion as well as multiple recurrent lesions. [1] The cells express both endothelial as well as histiocytic antigens, a characteristic feature of double differentiation of littoral cells, in contrast to the splenic red pulp cells that only express endothelial markers. The diagnosis of LCA relies on morphology and immunohistochemical studies. Fine needle aspiration cytology can aid in some cases in narrowing the differential before the operative excision of the tumor. [2]", "contents": "Littoral Cell Splenic Angioma -- Introduction.

However, there seems to be a role of immune dysregulation, as evident from the concomitant presence of other tumors and inflammation in the reported cases. [3] It is a primary vascular tumor arising from the cells lining the splenic red pulp venous sinuses, hence the name littoral cells. This lesion is a distinct entity from other splenic vascular lesions, e.g., angiosarcoma, as suggested by the dual (endothelial and histiocytic) differentiation pattern of the LCA. The immunohistochemical feature of the LCA cells is typical for co-expression of CD 68 and lysozyme (macrophage markers) and factor VIII and CD 31 (endothelial markers). The expression of the CD 68 marker is suggestive of the fact that the tumor is likely originating from the cells lining the splenic sinuses.

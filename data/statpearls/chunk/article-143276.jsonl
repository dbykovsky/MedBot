On the other hand, arrhythmias usually behave intermittently and in an all-or-none fashion. The impact of the arrhythmia occurs in the midst of the arrhythmia. When not occurring, there is nothing to treat. Despite coexisting with an underlying chronic disease, an arrhythmia will emerge entirely randomly and unpredictably. We have no simple or reliable means of verifying ongoing control of arrhythmias.", "contents": "Evaluation of Suspected Cardiac Arrhythmia -- Clinical Significance.

Our strategy should be focused on the latter. Luckily, the vast majority of arrhythmias fall within the nuisance category. Atrial fibrillation is the biggest exception. It can be present continuously, and significant consequences lying somewhere between nuisance and death do exist, such as stroke, heart failure, and dementia.", "contents": "Evaluation of Suspected Cardiac Arrhythmia -- Clinical Significance.

Patients should be advised to use an alternative\u00a0method of contraception. Quetiapine, a CYP3A4 substrate, exhibits increased plasma levels when coadministered with aprepitant. [32] IV compatibility: IV aprepitant is compatible with 5% dextrose injection and 0.9% sodium chloride injection. IV incompatibility:\u00a0IV aprepitant is incompatible with solutions containing divalent cations, such as magnesium and calcium, including Ringer lactate and Hartmann solutions. [33]"}

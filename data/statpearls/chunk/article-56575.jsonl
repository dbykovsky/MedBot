They also recommend that for workers who use or apply ammonia in farming, always follow proper safety precautions mentioned on the equipment and use personal protective equipment wherever necessary.", "contents": "Ammonia Toxicity -- Deterrence and Patient Education. The agency for toxic substances and disease registry (ATDSR) provides the following recommendations to the general public for avoiding ammonia exposure: Ammonia-based household cleaner use requires well-ventilated rooms. Avoid storing ammonia-based cleaners in glass bottles as breakage could lead to severe exposure. Wear proper clothing and use eye protection while using ammonia-based cleaners. Keep ammonia-based cleaners out of reach of children. Avoid visiting farming areas where ammonia-based fertilizers are applied, immediately after their application. Avoid visiting animal confinement buildings without the use of proper personal protective equipment.

The EMS team can obtain valuable insights into the exposure environment and may provide the first clue to ammonia poisoning. They can initiate decontamination before arriving in the emergency department. The emergency clinician, after primary and secondary surveys, should initiate early consultation for ophthalmology, gastroenterology, a burn nurse, and plastic surgery depending on the need.

CSF leakage can\u00a0evolve into a postdural puncture headache. The initial management of a postdural puncture headache is conservative, comprising intravenous fluid administration, supine positioning, increased caffeine intake, and utilization of nonopioid analgesics such as acetaminophen. If the headache is refractory to conservative management, a blood patch of 10 to 20 mL of autologous venous blood injected one level above the catheter entry point under fluoroscopic guidance should treat the headache effectively.

A comprehensive evaluation of the catheter is necessary if kinking, obstruction, or separation is suspected. This evaluation is performed with basic imaging or a catheter study; catheter studies require injecting contrast dye via the pump side port. Injecting contrast can display the point of kinking, obstruction, or leakage. The catheter should be aspirated before injecting contrast dye to avoid delivering a large dose of medication into the intrathecal space, which can lead to overdosage.", "contents": "Implantable Intrathecal Drug Delivery System -- Complications -- Catheter malfunction.

The risk of granuloma progression seems to correlate directly with the daily opioid dose, the rate of drug titration, and the duration of intrathecal therapy. If a granuloma is suspected, the diagnosis should be confirmed with an MRI, preferably with contrast. If a granuloma is present, the intrathecal medication should be decreased with careful titration to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and a neurosurgical consult may be necessary.

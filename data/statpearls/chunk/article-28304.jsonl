The pain commonly starts in the epigastrium and radiates towards the neck. A sour or burning fluid in the throat or mouth typically characterizes acid regurgitation. Maneuvers that increase intra-abdominal pressure, such as bending forward, may also provoke the regurgitation of gastric acid. [41] Dysphagia\u00a0is reported in 30% of patients with reflux esophagitis associated with peptic strictures, Schatzki rings, weak peristalsis, or mucosal inflammation.\u00a0Other symptoms of GERD can sometimes include a globus sensation or a lump in the throat and water brash, which involves increased salivary secretions in response to the acidity of the esophagus. [42] However, without heartburn and acid regurgitation, less common symptoms such as hoarseness, globus, nausea, abdominal pain, and dyspepsia are unlikely due to GERD. [5]"}

In the era of minimally invasive surgery techniques, many different types of endoscopic therapies have been developed for the management of GERD. Most of them were discontinued after failing to demonstrate long-term efficacy. Endoluminal therapies include magnetic sphincter augmentation and transoral incision-less fundoplication. [57]  A recent meta-analysis conducted by Gerson et al that\u00a0incorporated data from 233 patients demonstrated that subjects who underwent transoral incision-less fundoplication procedure had improved esophageal pH, decreased need for PPIs, and significant improvement in the quality of life 3 years following the procedure. [68] Another prospective study by Testoni et al demonstrated transoral incision-less fundoplication as an effective long-term treatment option for patients with symptomatic GERD with associated hiatal hernias less than 2 cm. A meta-analysis comparing Nissen fundoplication and magnetic sphincter augmentation that included data from 688 patients who underwent magnetic sphincter augmentation and the rest who were treated with Nissen fundoplication concluded that\u00a0the procedure was effective for GERD.

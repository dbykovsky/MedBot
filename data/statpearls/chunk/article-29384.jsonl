The spleen is composed of three areas; white pulp, red pulp, and a transitional zone, and each plays a role in the immune system. A minority of blood flow entering the spleen (approximately 10%) is directed outside of the vessels into the parenchyma of the red pulp, where the red blood cells (RBCs) become exposed to reticuloendothelial cells such as macrophages which clear away abnormal cells or other pathogens.

Mutations in the structure of the beta-globin can result in abnormal polymerization and aggregation of the beta-globin chains when they are in a deoxygenated state, rendering the RBC stiff and deformed into a sickled shape. [3] Sickle cell disease refers to a group of disorders in which both globin chains are abnormal, and at least one has the sickling mutation, while sickle cell anemia refers to those who are homozygous for the sickle cell mutation. In utero, fetal hemoglobin is produced, which has a higher affinity for oxygen and does not contain a beta-globin chain. Over the first few months of life, the infant\u2019s predominant hemoglobin transitions into adult-type hemoglobin, and the downstream effects of the mutated beta-globin chain begin to develop. The classic manifestation of sickle cell disease is vaso-occlusive events that occur in the small capillary beds, leading to sequelae such as pain crises, stroke, and acute chest syndrome. Within the spleen, the blood, which is directed to the red pulp flows slowly in a concentrated state as it becomes exposed to the reticuloendothelial cells of the immune system. [4] This situation promotes a deoxygenated state within the RBC that leads to polymerization and aggregate formation of deoxygenated beta-globin. These RBCs, now sickled, are unable to pass through the small endothelial slits of the venous sinuses and rejoin the intravascular system.

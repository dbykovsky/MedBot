According to the ASAM and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) practice guidelines in 2022, it is noted that morphine milligram equivalents (MME) do not apply to the management of OUD. MME is a numerical measure allowing for the comparison of the relative potency of various opioids in the context of pain management. A dosage of \u226550 MME per day is unlikely to provide additional pain relief or functional benefits. Before considering an escalation to a dosage of 90 MME per day or more, it is crucial to reassess the individual's benefits and risks. Special caution is advised when converting methadone doses due to its extended and variable half-life, with the peak respiratory depression occurring later and persisting longer than the peak analgesic effect.

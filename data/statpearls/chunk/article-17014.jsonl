A two-handed technique with the patient in the supine position is used to palpate the kidneys. To palpate the right kidney, place the left hand underneath the patient's back, pushing the kidney forward and the right hand below the right lower rib margin between the midclavicular and anterior axillary\u00a0lines, gently pushing down. This technique is called \u2018balloting.\u2019 To palpate the left kidney, the examiner should lean onto the patient with the left hand placed around the flank into the patient's loin and place the right hand on the abdomen\u00a0below the left lower rib margin between the mid-clavicular line and the anterior axillary\u00a0line. Enlarged or cystic kidneys may be appreciated using this technique."}

A two-handed technique is preferred, with the left and right hands placed along the lower borders of the left and right costal margins, respectively, and the fingers pointing toward the umbilicus. A generous amount of skin should be left between the two index fingers. The aorta can be palpated as a pulsatile mass, and its width can be recorded. A width greater than 2.5 cm indicates an aneurysm, and an abdominal ultrasound should be performed to investigate it further. However, an enlarged aneurysm may still not be appreciated by palpation due to body habitus.", "contents": "Abdominal Exam -- Function -- Palpation of the Abdomen.

After explaining the procedure, taking the patient\u2019s consent, and maintaining the patient\u2019s privacy, the rectal examination should be performed with proper technique. The examiner should place their lubricated, gloved finger against the patient\u2019s\u00a0rectal sphincter muscle to dilate the sphincter\u00a0and slowly slide it into the rectum palpating for hemorrhoids, fissures, or foreign bodies. The prostate for size and firmness should be assessed. Tenderness or bogginess suggests prostatitis, and nodules may suggest cancer. After the finger is removed, it should be inspected for signs of\u00a0active bleeding or melena. Perform a Guaiac test if bleeding is suspected.

It is performed in routine or scheduled examinations, in patients with focused or generalized trauma, in patients with non-specific complaints or specific abdominal or gastrointestinal complaints. The examination may be detailed or rapid, depending on the situation or condition necessitating the examination. However, the role of abdominal examination in the developed world has largely been replaced by imaging techniques in the past two and a half decades.

[18] The increased reliance on radiological investigations poses multiple issues. The patient\u2019s diagnosis, management, and the eventual outcome are highly dependant on multiple technicalities such as the quality of the machine, the ability of the technician working the machine, patient artifact, and the physician\u2019s experience in reading the investigation. An error in any of these steps may lead to under or over-diagnosis, both of which are detrimental to the patient.", "contents": "Abdominal Exam -- Issues of Concern.

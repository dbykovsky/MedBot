Early and late postprandial hypoglycemia occurs 2 to 3 hours and 3 to 5 hours after a meal, respectively. [39] A five-hour oral glucose tolerance test (5-OGTT) is often a helpful laboratory investigation to understand and establish a diagnosis of postprandial hypoglycemia. However, in clinical practice, the use of a 5-OGTT is discredited for diagnosing reactive hypoglycemia as it may show false-positive results. [40]"}
{"id": "article-22312_22", "title": "Glucose Tolerance Test -- Quality Control and Lab Safety", "content": "For non-waived tests, laboratory regulations require, at the minimum, analysis of at least two levels of control materials once every 24 hours. Laboratories can assay QC samples more frequently to ensure accurate results. [41] Quality control samples should be assayed after calibration or maintenance of an analyzer to verify the correct method performance. To minimize QC when performing tests for which manufacturer recommendations are less than those required by the regulatory agency (such as once per month), the labs can develop an individualized quality control plan (IQCP) that involves performing a risk assessment of potential sources of error in all phases of testing and putting in place a QC plan to reduce the likelihood of errors. [42] Westgard multi-rules are used to evaluate the quality control runs. In case of any rule violation, proper corrective and preventive action should be taken before patient testing.

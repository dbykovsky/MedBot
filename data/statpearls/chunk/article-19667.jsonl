It can present in a variety of ways, but the most common symptom is a headache. Hydrocephalus is common and may be present early or late during the disease and is a common complication. The most common life-threatening complication of coccidial meningitis in the modern era is CNS vasculitis leading to cerebral ischemia, infarction, and hemorrhage. Clinically, a patient may present with cerebral infarction and stroke. Spinal arachnoiditis (SA) may occur as a complication, but unlike infarctions and hydrocephalus, arachnoiditis is not an initial presentation. Recently, there has been an increase in the incidence of spinal arachnoiditis post-treatment with azole antifungal agents. SA responds better to intrathecal amphotericin B. Cerebral abscesses and mass lesions secondary to Coccidioides infection have rarely been reported. Eosinophils in CSF are uncommon, but when present, are suggestive of the diagnosis. More typical is the lymphocytic predominance but often neutrophil predominance is seen. Fluconazole was demonstrated to be equivalent to amphotericin B in 1988 and since then has been the drug of choice at 800 mg to 1200 mg daily dose. Both clinical and CSF parameters should be monitored at least monthly. Once improvement occurs, follow-up may be done every three months for life.

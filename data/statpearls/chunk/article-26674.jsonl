The nonmotor symptoms like psychiatric, autonomic, and sensory are much harder to manage. Simply adding more medications to the patient's regimen is not the answer because of potential adverse reactions and drug-drug reactions. Current recommendations include: Sildenafil to treat erectile dysfunction Modafinil for day time somnolence Polyethylene glycol for constipation Levodopa for period limb movements during sleep Methylphenidate for fatigue Dementia is managed with cholinesterase inhibitors Depression is managed with SSRIs Psychotic symptoms are managed with antipsychotics and pimavanserin. Anxiety is managed with SSRIs Impulse behaviors are managed by cognitive behavior therapy"}

DBS involves stimulation of the STN, globus pallidus interna, and the thalamus. However, DBS is not complication-free; it is prohibitively expensive, and its long-term benefits remain debatable. More evidence indicates that exercise can help improve gait, balance, and flexibility. Unfortunately, the benefits of exercise are not sustained; the risk of falls is very high. Speech therapy may help some patients.", "contents": "Parkinson Disease -- Treatment / Management.

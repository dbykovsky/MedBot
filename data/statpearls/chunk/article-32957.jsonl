Further insights into tensor tympani and stapedius myoclonus reveal that sawtooth patterns on long-term tympanometry can serve as indicators for tensor tympani myoclonus. The primary approach to medical therapy involves the inhibition of muscle spasms, while tenotomy emerges as a potential intervention following medical treatment failure, showing promising outcomes based on current data."}

Healthcare workers, including nurse practitioners, should refer these patients to an ENT surgeon for further workup. Management of patients with middle ear myoclonus (MEM), specifically tensor tympani syndrome, varies depending on the severity of symptoms and expectations. Physicians have reportedly used benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, piracetam, botulinum toxin, and orphenadrine citrate with varying mechanisms of action for MEM with questionable efficacy. Clinicians can use benzodiazepines to potentially decrease symptoms by targeting the anxiolytic component of the disorder as well as functioning as a muscle relaxant. Another possible intervention that targets the contraction of the tensor tympani muscle is via botulinum toxin. While new to MEM, botulinum toxin's well-documented use in non-cosmetic otolaryngology-associated disease processes, such as hemifacial spasm, and laryngeal pathology, like spasmodic dysphonia, is notable.", "contents": "Tensor Tympani Syndrome -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

The most common procedure for tensor tympani syndrome (and stapedius myoclonus) is tympanotomy with tensor tympani or stapedius tenotomy. Tinnitus itself is not harmful. However, the underlying process can be life-threatening, such as in multiple sclerosis. Other than the underlying disease process, tinnitus can cause a range of emotional distress to patients, from severely debilitating to causing little to no distress. Additionally, there is not enough data to predict whether symptoms will discontinue or reduce, regardless of whether or not there is an identifiable cause for the tinnitus.", "contents": "Tensor Tympani Syndrome -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

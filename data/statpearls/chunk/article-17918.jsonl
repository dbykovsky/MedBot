The Nottingham sensory assessment is a good method to assess the tactile and kinesthetic sensations and stereognosis. Patients with astereognosis are best managed with an interprofessional team approach. There is a significant role in rehabilitation after the acute treatment of neurological diseases. This may include neurologists, physiatrists, occupational therapy, physical therapy, and speech therapy. Sensory training should be given as much importance as motor training.

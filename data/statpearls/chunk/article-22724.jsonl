The conventional therapy for primary hemochromatosis is phlebotomy. By drawing off red blood cells, the major mobilizer of iron in the body, iron toxicity, can be minimized. [20] Patients may require 50 to 100 phlebotomies of 500 mL each to reduce iron levels to normal. Phlebotomy is usually performed once or twice a week. Once iron levels have normalized, lifelong, but less frequent, phlebotomy (typically 3-4 times a year) is required. The objective is to obtain a ferritin level of less than 50 mcg/L.

Data can be organized in numerous ways, so every researcher should only use methods depending on the specific goal of the study.

This is usually done in studies having a small population (e.g., case studies, case series).\u00a0 Otherwise, if the data needs to be described using frequency distribution, it can be organized either as discrete or continuous data series using frequency tables. This\u00a0collection process\u00a0is frequently used in studies with a larger study population. It is important to note that the best method of organizing statistical data primarily depends on the type of variable (e.g., qualitative or quantitative) and its level of measurement (e.g., nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio).

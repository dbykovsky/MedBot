As with the standard surface ECG, this intracardiac physiologic phenomenon helps narrow the localization of the accessory pathway during an electrophysiologic study. A sudden bundle branch block with prolongation in the VA interval occurs on the side where the functional block is occurring, that is, on the side of the accessory pathway. Another technique used during an electrophysiologic study involves producing a His-synchronous ventricular premature beat delivered either during His depolarization or within 40 msec of His depolarization. This technique\u00a0is performed to determine whether the ventricular premature beat resulted in  an advancement of atrial depolarization. If the subsequent atrial signal is advanced by the ventricular premature beat (that is, arrived earlier than expected), it indicates the presence of\u00a0an accessory pathway. When the SVT terminates without conducting to the atrium, this shows not only the presence of an accessory pathway but also a pathway necessary for the arrhythmia circuit and not just a possible bystander accessory pathway. Differential ventricular pacing performed at the base and the apex of the right ventricle can also help detect an accessory pathway. In the absence of an accessory pathway, the VA interval is shorter when pacing is performed\u00a0from the apex compared to\u00a0the base of the ventricle, as it retrogradely conducts through the His-Purkinje system and atrioventricular node to the right atrium.

[22]", "contents": "Atrioventricular Reciprocating Tachycardia -- Evaluation -- Electrophysiologic Study. During an electrophysiologic study, AVRT can be diagnosed when a bundle branch block occurs simultaneously with an increase in the VA interval (time interval between the earliest QRS deflection on the surface ECG and the earliest atrial deflection in the His bundle intracardiac electrogram) greater than 20 msec. As with the standard surface ECG, this intracardiac physiologic phenomenon helps narrow the localization of the accessory pathway during an electrophysiologic study. A sudden bundle branch block with prolongation in the VA interval occurs on the side where the functional block is occurring, that is, on the side of the accessory pathway. Another technique used during an electrophysiologic study involves producing a His-synchronous ventricular premature beat delivered either during His depolarization or within 40 msec of His depolarization. This technique\u00a0is performed to determine whether the ventricular premature beat resulted in  an advancement of atrial depolarization. If the subsequent atrial signal is advanced by the ventricular premature beat (that is, arrived earlier than expected), it indicates the presence of\u00a0an accessory pathway.

[16]", "contents": "Neuroanatomy, Mesencephalon Midbrain -- Physiologic Variants. There are a significant number of recognized malformations of the brainstem, which can each lead to specific presentations. There are, however, few disorders known that affect mostly the midbrain. One condition caused by midbrain dysplasia results in many symptoms in affected people, including microcephaly, intellectual disability, and seizures. [15] In some patients with dysfunction of multiple organ systems, a shortened midbrain and elongated pons were found. This malformation was due to the malfunction of development along the anterior-posterior axis. Another disorder caused by the opposite problem, an elongation of the midbrain, results in a secondary hypoplastic cerebellum. [16]"}

The syndrome is inducible by ischemic lesions, neoplasms of the corpora quadrigemina, pinealomas, hydrocephalus, cysticercosis, multiple sclerosis, and arteriovenous malformations. Its distinguishing symptom is a decreased or absent gaze upwards.

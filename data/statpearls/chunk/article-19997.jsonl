It is important to note that EK procedures are not suitable for patients with healthy corneal endothelium and are only recommended for patients with specific conditions such as keratoconus, Fuchs endothelial dystrophy, posterior polymorphous dystrophy, CHED, bullous keratopathy, iridocorneal endothelial syndrome, and failed EKs. [36] DALK is another surgical procedure that focuses on the anterior cornea (epithelium, Bowman layer, and stroma) and is recommended for patients with keratoconus and corneal scars. The indications for DALK include deep stromal scars caused by healed infective keratitis, healed chemical injuries with deep stromal scars, keratoconus, and stromal dystrophies. [37]"}

Remarkably, only a modest 30% to 40% gap exists between the available corneas and the escalating demand.", "contents": "Cornea Transplantation -- Clinical Significance.

{"id": "article-19997_56", "title": "Cornea Transplantation -- Clinical Significance", "content": "An inherent challenge is that corneal endothelial cells (CECs) resist expansion post-biopsy in laboratory conditions. Recent research has explored alternative stem cells, including mesenchymal stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells directed towards a neural crest and endothelial lineage through rho-associated protein kinase inhibition. [63] [64] Large animal models have demonstrated promising results in generating CECs in vitro. [65] Upon further optimization, this approach may emerge as a therapeutic avenue for endothelial replacement, particularly in cases of CEC dysfunction, such as in Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy. The ongoing exploration of these regenerative strategies holds the potential to redefine the landscape of corneal transplantation, offering innovative solutions for challenging clinical scenarios.", "contents": "Cornea Transplantation -- Clinical Significance.

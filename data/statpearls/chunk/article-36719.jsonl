Influences from horizontal and amacrine cells shape Cone-to-BC and BC-to-RGC signaling within the retina. [4] [5] As a rule, each cone transmits information to over a dozen functional subtypes of cone BCs, and therefore cone signals are relayed to RGCs via many functionally distinct parallel pathways.

[9] Signaling within the retina that produces such functional RGC diversity is thought to enhance visual perception. Photopic visual signals travel via RGCs to many targets in the brain and contribute to both image forming and non-image forming vision, the latter of which includes light-mediated regulation of pupillary aperture, circadian cycles, and head-eye movement coordination.

As a consequence, colored stimuli are absorbed and propagated slightly differently by the three cone classes.

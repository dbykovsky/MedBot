Surgical options may be necessary alone or in combination. [12] Type II fractures require repair or reconstruction of the extensor mechanism with suture, allograft, autograft, or xenograft. Type IIIa fractures are amenable to revision patellar arthroplasty or resection (patelloplasty). Type IIIb fractures with a loose patellar button and poor bone stock should undergo patelloplasty or total patellectomy.

Er:YAG laser endpoints include the appearance of petechial bleeding (indicating ablation entering the papillary dermis), a yellow color (termed chamois color), which indicates ablation of the midpapillary dermis, and visual effacement of rhytids. [14] However, these clinical endpoints are not typically apparent when using fractionated beam delivery, only for full-field ablation. Ideally, the boundaries of the treated area should correspond to the boundaries of facial aesthetic units to make the edges of the treatment area less apparent. When performing a full facial ablation, most clinicians will feather the laser along the jawline to blend the treated area into the neck but not treat the neck itself because its dermis is very thin (approximately 140\u00a0\u03bcm), and it does not heal as well or as rapidly as the face because it lacks a high concentration of pilosebaceous units.", "contents": "Laser Erbium-Yag Resurfacing -- Technique or Treatment. Superficial resurfacing can be achieved with a fluence of 5\u00a0to 10 J/cm^2\u00a0or a treatment depth of fewer than 250 \u03bcm. This approach removes part or all of the epidermis and can result in mild improvement in the appearance of photoaging with a shorter \"down-time\" and recovery period, as well as a decreased requirement for anesthesia.

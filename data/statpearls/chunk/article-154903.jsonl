Of note, there have been data to suggest the administration of acetaminophen and aspirin as they may inhibit toluene metabolism (CYP2E1 as the site of competitive metabolic interaction), limiting the acute production of hippuric acid. [21] In a study with 40 subjects, psychosis or behavioral changes were reduced by treatment with carbamazepine and haloperidol by 50%. [38] Aggressive fluid management is helpful as toluene metabolites are water soluble and renally excreted. [45] Patients presenting in extremis due to toluene toxicity have benefited from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. [46]"}

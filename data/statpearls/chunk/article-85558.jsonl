Some recommend a preoperative evaluation with EGD before restrictive procedures such as sleeve gastrectomy or adjustable gastric banding. These restrictive procedures may place these patients at a greater risk of worsening gastroesophageal reflux and Barrett's esophagus. Bypass procedures such as Roux en-Y gastric bypass will result in an inaccessible foregut, which will make a further evaluation of the upper gastrointestinal tract difficult. [32] The current recommendations are that an EGD preoperatively should be performed on an individualized basis and in patients with significant gastrointestinal symptoms. [33] [34]"}

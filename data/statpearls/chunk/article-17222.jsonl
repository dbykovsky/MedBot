They are, in the order of decreasing frequency\u2014 oncocytic, myxoid, and sarcomatoid carcinomas. Adrenal myxoid carcinomas and sarcomatoid carcinomas are rare. Myxoid carcinoma has abundant extracellular mucin in the stroma. Using the Weiss score, a patient with this subtype of adrenal\u00a0cortical carcinoma may be underdiagnosed. Sarcomatoid carcinoma reveals the loss of cortical differentiation. The carcinoma may have a common cortical carcinoma area (biphasic). Sarcomatoid carcinoma needs to be differentiated from retroperitoneal sarcoma involving the adrenal gland, especially when the typical cortical carcinoma area is monophasic.\u00a0In these instances, a battery of immunostains can provide evidence of adrenocortical differentiation, [45] including but not limited to the following proteins that are expressed in most ACCs: alpha inhibin, [46] [47] calretinin, [48] synaptophysin, [49] melanA (Mart1), [50] and\u00a0SFI. [42] [51] SF-1 is an orphan nuclear receptor that gets expressed in the adrenal gland, gonads, spleen, ventromedial hypothalamus, and pituitary gonadotropic cells and has a role in steroidogenesis and development. It has high sensitivity and specificity in identifying the cortical origin of\u00a0the adrenal mass. The expression of SF-1 also correlates with a poor clinical outcome in patients with adrenal cortical carcinoma. On the other hand, synaptophysin commonly expresses in adrenal cortical carcinoma. The expression of synaptophysin in cortical carcinoma should be interpreted with caution because it can be confused with a\u00a0 pheochromocytoma. Also, adrenal cortical carcinoma can stain positive for cytokeratin. In general, adrenocortical carcinoma does not express the common cytokeratins. Chromogranin A expression is universally not present, and if it is present, an adrenomedullary tumor should be a strong consideration.

Apart from conventional adrenocortical carcinoma, the latest WHO classification also recognizes some histological variants. They are, in the order of decreasing frequency\u2014 oncocytic, myxoid, and sarcomatoid carcinomas. Adrenal myxoid carcinomas and sarcomatoid carcinomas are rare. Myxoid carcinoma has abundant extracellular mucin in the stroma. Using the Weiss score, a patient with this subtype of adrenal\u00a0cortical carcinoma may be underdiagnosed. Sarcomatoid carcinoma reveals the loss of cortical differentiation. The carcinoma may have a common cortical carcinoma area (biphasic). Sarcomatoid carcinoma needs to be differentiated from retroperitoneal sarcoma involving the adrenal gland, especially when the typical cortical carcinoma area is monophasic.\u00a0In these instances, a battery of immunostains can provide evidence of adrenocortical differentiation, [45] including but not limited to the following proteins that are expressed in most ACCs: alpha inhibin, [46] [47] calretinin, [48] synaptophysin, [49] melanA (Mart1), [50] and\u00a0SFI. [42] [51] SF-1 is an orphan nuclear receptor that gets expressed in the adrenal gland, gonads, spleen, ventromedial hypothalamus, and pituitary gonadotropic cells and has a role in steroidogenesis and development. It has high sensitivity and specificity in identifying the cortical origin of\u00a0the adrenal mass. The expression of SF-1 also correlates with a poor clinical outcome in patients with adrenal cortical carcinoma. On the other hand, synaptophysin commonly expresses in adrenal cortical carcinoma. The expression of synaptophysin in cortical carcinoma should be interpreted with caution because it can be confused with a\u00a0 pheochromocytoma. Also, adrenal cortical carcinoma can stain positive for cytokeratin. In general, adrenocortical carcinoma does not express the common cytokeratins.

These data establish the role of targeted disruption of IGF-1R signaling to obtain a therapeutic advantage when used with mitotane therapy or possibly other chemotherapeutics in ACC patients. [106] Recently, a phase 2 study used an IMCA12 (cixutumumab), a fully humanized\u00a0IGF-IR antibody showed a lack of efficacy in a cohort of 19 patients. [107] Also, results of a huge phase 3 trial \u201cGALACCTIC\u201d with a highly specific IGF-IR inhibitor linstinib\u00a0(OSI-906)in a cohort of 138 metastatic ACC have been recently published: the progression-free and overall survival did not differ between the\u00a0linstinib and placebo groups. [108] However, in another study, 26 heavily pretreated ACC patients received cixutumumab\u00a0with temsirolimus, an inhibitor of mammalian targets of IGF-1R signaling (mTOR inhibitor)weekly with restaging at eight weeks. Of these 26 patients, 11 (42%) had stable disease for greater than six months. [109] Finally, because of disease heterogeneity, it appears that using one single agent is not sufficient to induce an objective response. Trials with new targeted substances are underway."}

In worse forms of the disease, the bulbar, limb, and respiratory muscles can also be affected. A similar condition is Lambert-Eaton, where autoantibodies target the presynaptic calcium channels, resulting in the inability of the neuron to release acetylcholine into the NMJ. [7] Both of these conditions are due to the cells' inability to attach acetylcholine to their cellular receptor.", "contents": "Physiology, Cellular Receptor -- Clinical Significance -- Myasthenia Gravis.

In complete androgen insensitivity, the presentation is often a healthy female child found to have inguinal masses that contain testes. Patients are also commonly identified during puberty when they fail to menstruate. Upon testing, patients have abnormally high levels of testosterone, LH, and FSH due to the failure of the negative feedback loop in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis.", "contents": "Physiology, Cellular Receptor -- Clinical Significance -- Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome.

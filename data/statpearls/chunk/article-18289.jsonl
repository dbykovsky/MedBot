One important checkpoint is obtaining laboratory values at regular intervals; this is a safety measure to ensure a prescribed drug is maintained within the therapeutic range. In addition to ensuring drug efficacy through adequate plasma drug concentration, this checkpoint can serve as a method to prevent drug accumulation and toxicity. Between these intervals, checking patient vitals more frequently in patients with complex illnesses and medication lists is useful for monitoring acute physiologic reactions secondary to changes in drug bioavailability.", "contents": "Drug Bioavailability -- Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions.

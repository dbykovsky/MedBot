Though rarely observed, the Girdle syndrome is a clinical syndrome in which vaso-occlusion occurs in the lungs, liver, and mesentery with a characteristic pain in a girdle-like distribution. [27] [13] The diagnosis of vasa-occlusive crisis-related gastrointestinal ischemia is based on the presentation of acute abdominal pain crisis, a constellation of clinical findings, and a lack of alternate explanations for the situation. An abdominal-pelvic CT with contrast may reveal the target appearance of bowel wall thickening with mucosal hyperenhancement and submucosal edema. Other cases in the literature have shown mucosal necrosis, transmural necrosis, hemorrhagic changes with edema, and thromboses in the mesenteric arteries and arterioles. The rarity of ischemic bowel in sickle cell disease might be due to the extensive collateral circulation in the mesentery and bowel wall. The collateral circulation offers a modicum of protection. Supportive care brings resolution in uncomplicated cases. [27] In severe cases, there may be bowel perforation requiring emergency surgery."}

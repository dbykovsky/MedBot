These agents cause demyelination and axonal destruction via protein denaturation and axonal necrosis. [20] These agents\u00a0also\u00a0are injected using electrostimulation or electromyography (EMG) guidance. Agents used for these procedures include phenol and ethyl alcohol. [12] [21] Phenol\u00a0typically\u00a0is used in concentrations ranging from 2% to 7%. Lower concentrations achieve demyelination, leading to a transient anesthetic effect, but achieve minimal axonolysis. The effects of higher concentrations are neurolytic as they destroy axons, lasting greater than 6 months. Ethyl alcohol should be used at a concentration of 45% to 100% to achieve neurolytic effects. It is less commonly used than phenol and is less toxic.\u00a0A common adverse effect of chemoneurolysis is dysesthesias, which means pain in the sensory distribution of the blocked nerve. The reported incidence ranges from 10% to 30%, lasting weeks to months.\u00a0 Additional adverse effects are muscle weakness (which may be permanent), transient swelling or nodule formation within the muscle itself, DVT, sprains, and skin sloughing (more common when injecting phenol). Phenol, if injected intravascularly, can lead to serious systemic reactions such as convulsions, CNS depression, and cardiovascular failure.

The FDA has approved three type A toxins, onabotulinumtoxin A, incobotulinumtoxin A, and abobotulinumtoxin A, and one type B toxin,\u00a0rimabotuinumtoxin B, for clinical use. [21] Currently, onabotulinumtoxin A is approved for use in both upper and lower limb spasticity in five specific muscles, and incobotulinumtoxin A has been approved for upper limb spasticity. All serotypes function at the neuromuscular junction, where they block the presynaptic release of acetylcholine. The toxin is taken up by the nerve terminal, affecting the SNARE complex and its components: synaptobrevin, SNAP-25, and syntaxin. The botulinum toxin is released from the bacterium Clostridium botulinum in the form of one heavy and one light chain. The light chain is the active portion, and once it enters the host cell cytoplasm, it cleaves\u00a0to the host protein SNAP-25, which is responsible for fusion. Once cleaved, SNAP-25 is not able to fuse vesicles. Thus, the overall effect is to prevent the exocytosis of acetylcholine-containing vesicles into the nerve terminal cleft, causing chemical denervation. Botulinum toxin is contraindicated in patients with a known sensitivity if there is evidence of infection at the planned injection site. The toxin should be used with caution if a patient is undergoing concurrent treatment with aminoglycoside or spectinomycin antibiotics. Patients with an underlying neuromuscular disease, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), myasthenia gravis, Lambert-Eaton syndrome, or peripheral motor neuropathic disease, are at increased risk of severe reactions including respiratory depression or dysphagia. As above, electrical stimulation, EMG, or ultrasound are all methods to localize the muscle in question. [23] The clinician\u00a0also\u00a0should be aware of the dose-dependent response, meaning that more toxin load per muscle results in increased weakness clinically. Onabotulinumtoxin A is typically injected in units ranging from 25 to 200 per muscle, depending on muscle size, function, patient weight, and amount of spasticity. The typical effect of the toxin lasts up to 3 months, at which point the patient may need re-injection. The toxin takes 24 to 72 hours to take action and achieves peak effect between 4 and 6 weeks, from which clinicians refer to the \u201crule of 3s\u201d: 3 days for initial effect, 3 weeks for peak effect, 3 months duration.

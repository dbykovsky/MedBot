Half or more patients with even one episode of prolonged priapism will develop ED. This rate increases with the repeated episodes found in stuttering priapism. Liability exposure to the treating physicians is relatively high as patients may become upset with a poor outcome (ED) or repeated episodes of priapism despite correct treatment and counseling on presentation.

Though transient, it can progress to ischemic priapism, necessitating immediate intervention to prevent complications like erectile dysfunction. Most commonly seen in SCD patients, stuttering priapism has varied treatment approaches. Hormonal manipulation via GnRH agents, antiandrogens, or ketoconazole aims to lower testosterone levels, reducing episodes but may affect fertility. Medications altering cavernosal muscle tone (pseudoephedrine, digoxin, terbutaline) show mixed efficacy. Other agents like gabapentin, hydroxyurea, and sildenafil have demonstrated promise, especially in SCD-related cases. Additionally, automated red cell exchanges or penile prosthesis implantation serve as alternate therapies for intractable cases. Standardized management guidelines and further research are warranted for effective stuttering priapism care.", "contents": "Stuttering Priapism -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

[6] Head Impulse test: In vestibular disorders that cause vertigo, the head impulse test is often positive. The performance of this test is as follows: The examiner sits across the patient and holds the patient's head between both palms. The examiner asks the patient to fix the gaze on the examiner's nose. The head is rotated slightly laterally, about 10-20 degrees to one side. Subsequently, the examiner brings the head back to the primary position in a swift motion while continually observing the patient's eyes. Individuals with an intact vestibular system (and thus an intact vestibulo-ocular reflex) can maintain their gaze on the examiner's nose. A corrective horizontal saccade is seen in a patient with unilateral vestibular damage when the head rotates to the primary position from the side with the vestibular lesion. The test is then repeated for the contralateral side. It is essential to rule out lesions of the cervical spine or paraspinal musculature before performing this test. If the examiner is doubtful about the integrity of the neck or the spine, it is best to avoid this test altogether. Nystagmus: In comparison to nystagmus of peripheral etiology as described above, the nystagmus of central etiology has the following features: Bi-directional (gaze-evoked): The direction of nystagmus changes with the direction of gaze Central nystagmus may also be vertical, which is uncommon in nystagmus of peripheral etiology. Test of Skew: In lesions involving the brainstem, vertical malalignment of the eyes may present (skew deviation). The alternate cover test can demonstrate this.

{"id": "article-18708_86", "title": "Buprenorphine -- Toxicity -- Pearls of Wisdom", "content": "Buprenorphine acts as a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and is generally considered safer than methadone. However, combining it with other CNS depressants, such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, can lead to respiratory depression and should be avoided. If an overdose occurs with buprenorphine, significantly higher doses of naloxone, along with other supportive measures, are necessary. Due to its partial opioid agonist nature, the drug has a lower potential for dependence and misuse compared to pure agonists such as heroin or morphine; however, it can still be misused. Incorporating naloxone into the formula is intended to further reduce the risk of substance misuse by injection but does not always eliminate the risk. Unlike methadone, the therapeutic dose of buprenorphine can be titrated to a stable dose within several days. In contrast, methadone often takes many weeks or even months to reach a therapeutic dose.", "contents": "Buprenorphine -- Toxicity -- Pearls of Wisdom.

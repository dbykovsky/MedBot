Glycogen storage disease Type V, McArdle disease, develops due to a skeletal muscle glycogen phosphorylase deficiency. Patients display exercise intolerance, muscle weakness, cramping, and pain. Creatine kinase levels\u00a0are elevated, and myoglobinuria can also develop. A typical symptom of\u00a0McArdle disease is second wind, where patients can resume exercise when resting briefly. Ingestion of sucrose before exercise can help alleviate symptoms since this becomes the energy source during exercise before resorting to glycogen stores."}

Symptoms include ataxia, seizures, myoclonus, and dementia. Abnormal phosphorylation levels in glycogen lead to longer chains and irregular branch points that render the polymer insoluble and degradation-resistant. As a result, patients with this condition have a conglomerate of inclusion bodies called Lafora bodies. [5]", "contents": "Biochemistry, Glycogenesis -- Pathophysiology.

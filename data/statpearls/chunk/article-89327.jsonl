CTK generally manifests within nine days of excimer laser ablation, though there is documentation of other etiologies. Clinical signs include a central or paracentral amorphous opacity with striae, hyperopic shift, and stromal loss. The opacification may clear significantly without treatment, and the stroma will regenerate to a degree; however, hyperopia and striae may remain. The best treatment for CTK is subject to debate, and its general rarity makes well-controlled treatment studies difficult. However, most clinicians do not recommend invasive intervention. Steroids are universally understood to be of little or no benefit and are not warranted. Other corneal protective agents may be of use.

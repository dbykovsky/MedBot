With these patients, purse-lip breathing may not be a voluntary action, but rather a compensatory mechanism to help splint open the airways. [7] [8] COPD individuals may have chronic obstruction of their airways from mucus plugging, loss of integrity of the airways, or enlargement of the airways. These changes in the airways can prevent the appropriate driving pressure and flow of air to maintain an adequate clearance of carbon dioxide due to an increase in airway resistance. [9] The increase in airway resistance also affects inhalation preventing enough oxygen from reaching the alveoli to create a sufficient partial pressure of oxygen needed to drive the diffusion of oxygen across the alveoli-capillary interface adequately. The defected driving pressure for oxygenation is further exacerbated due to the retention of carbon dioxide, causing less carbon dioxide to diffuse from the blood into the alveoli for excretion. The blunting of the proper mechanism to excrete carbon dioxide and adequate oxygenation leads to a constant stimulus to the central chemoreceptors to increase respiration until the point of exhaustion. Chronic hypercapnia decreases the sensitivity of the central chemoreceptors, allowing peripheral receptors sensing oxygen levels to become the predominantly drive for respiration.

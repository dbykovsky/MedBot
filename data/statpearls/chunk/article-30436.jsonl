Physicians, including otolaryngologists, surgeons, anesthesiologists, and pulmonologists, set protocols, oversee training, and intervene in complex cases. Advanced practitioners give routine care, conduct assessments, educate patients, and collaborate across the healthcare team. Nurses contribute expertise in patient assessment, procedural care, and post-procedure monitoring for swift responses to complications. Pharmacists, leveraging their medication expertise, focus on drug-related aspects to enhance safety. Respiratory therapists or physiotherapists play a pivotal role in managing chest function, secretion clearance, and conducting pulmonary rehabilitation. Simultaneously, speech and language therapists are crucial during tube changes, influencing decisions on tube types and ensuring optimal airway management.", "contents": "Tracheostomy Tube Change -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

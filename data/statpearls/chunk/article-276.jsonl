All patients\u00a0showing\u00a0an\u00a0acute, allergic-like reaction to contrast should immediately have contrast administration stopped if possible, and receive hydration\u00a0as well as\u00a0antihistamine treatment. Although the literature review\u00a0demonstrates\u00a0an absence of specific medication regimens,\u00a0treatment for allergic-like reactions to contrast agents is typically comprised\u00a0of intravenous fluids, diphenhydramine, hydrocortisone, or adrenaline in severe anaphylactoid presentations. Prophylactic medication regimens including prednisone,\u00a0methylprednisone, hydrocortisone, and diphenhydramine have also been\u00a0used\u00a0in patients with allergic risk factors. A systematic review found a small reduction in respiratory symptoms and hemodynamic compromise with pretreatment with an estimated number needed to treat (NNT) of 100 to 150.

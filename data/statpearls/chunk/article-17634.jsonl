The brain arrest neurological outcome scale (BrANOS) was formulated using retrospective data that incorporates radiologic findings into prognosis in addition to the Glasgow Coma Scale and duration of cardiac arrest. Combining these data, the prognosis of severe neurologic disability and mortality was estimated at up to 90% accuracy. [23] However, these data did not include patients who underwent therapeutic hypothermia; therefore, this scale has not yet been fully validated and is not recommended for routine use."}
{"id": "article-17634_28", "title": "Anoxic Encephalopathy -- Prognosis", "content": "In addition to prognostic scales, a physical test can provide prognostic information using stimulation of the median nerve bilaterally. This testing evaluates for somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP), which are averaged electrical responses in the central nervous system to somatosensory stimulation peripherally to remove the possibility of peripheral nervous system damage confounding exam findings. This testing does require expert consultation for implementation and interpretation. SSEP evaluation aims to evaluate the presence of N20 response from the primary somatosensory cortex bilaterally. [24] If absent bilaterally within the first week, often tested 24 to 72 hours post-arrest, there will likely be no outcome better than a persistent vegetative state. [25] In addition, SSEP testing has also been demonstrated to be the least susceptible testing to metabolic change as well as drugs. [24] If the N20 response is present upon initial testing, consideration to test a second time should be given after the first week has passed, as the N20 response may extinguish at that time.", "contents": "Anoxic Encephalopathy -- Prognosis.

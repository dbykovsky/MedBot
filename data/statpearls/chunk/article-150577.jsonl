Preoperative psychosocial and behavioral assessment is strongly recommended for patients considering weight loss surgery. Patients with obesity frequently have underlying mood, eating, and behavioral disorders that, if left unidentified and unmanaged, negatively affect postoperative outcomes and overall weight loss. [38] Psychosocial assessment can also identify deficiencies and provide strategies for improving interpersonal relationships, support systems, and lifestyle behaviors to\u00a0achieve and sustain weight loss after surgery.

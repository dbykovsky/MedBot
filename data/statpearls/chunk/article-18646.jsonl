Many inhaled irritants to the respiratory tract, such as smog, industrial pollutants, and toxic chemicals, can cause chronic bronchitis.

The predominant viruses that are causative are Influenza types A and B, and the dominant bacterial agents\u00a0are Staphylococcus , Streptococcus , and Mycoplasma\u00a0pneumonia .

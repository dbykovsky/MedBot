The initial intervention for a patient with myelomeningocele includes intravenous antibiotics, neurosurgical closure of the defect within\u00a024 to 48 hours of birth to prevent infections and later complications, and ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement if the patient develops hydrocephalus. If the infant is in a critical\u00a0status secondary to respiratory failure, sepsis, or\u00a0other gross congenital organ anomalies causing life-threatening problems, initial supportive\u00a0care\u00a0is\u00a0recommended. [28] The surgical procedure involves reversing the failed steps of normal spinal cord closure employing extensive knowledge of normal anatomy and embryology. [16] It is carried out under general anesthesia with an endotracheal tube. In the first step, the neural placode is separated, tubularized, and then stitched. After that, the dura is separated from the underlying tissues and closed. Then the skin is approximated and sutured. [1] Postoperative care has a vital role in the success of the surgery. The patient should be given prophylactic antibiotics, painkillers, and good nutrition. It is important to ensure that patient is nursed in a prone position to avoid aspiration and wound dehiscence. Wound care is essential to avoid wound infection. Dressing change and avoiding urinary and fecal contamination of the wound is necessary. The patient should also be monitored and treated for urinary problems. [8] Recently, specialized centers are performing fetal myelomeningocele closure. This reduces the development of hydrocephalus, but at the risk of an increase in prenatal complications and preterm birth.

Medications for vascular conditions, such as statins, often cause side effects and affect the therapeutic window of other drugs. Although statins\u00a0offer an evidence-based therapeutic advantage for reducing arterial cholesterol and inflammation and have become\u00a0almost universal for treating atherosclerosis (representing one of the significant advances in clinical medicine since 1987), they\u00a0frequently cause hepatotoxicity and myositis. The ACC recommends that, prior to starting a patient on a statin, a VHCP should determine the patient's baseline alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level to enable the detection of increases in this level\u00a0attributable to the statin to guide future management decisions.

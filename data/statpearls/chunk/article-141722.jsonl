In general, from an ethical, legal, and business standpoint, patient needs should prioritize the needs of all other stakeholders in the healthcare process. In real life, however, when there is a conflict in goals between the patient-customer and the business or HCP, persons working in healthcare often de-prioritize patient-customer goals. Healthcare managers and HCPs can better serve patient-customers by learning their objectives, aligning business goals with patient/customers' goals when it is ethically and legally appropriate to do so, and by 'activating' patient-customers. [15] Activating customers means enabling them to manage their own service transactions by increasing their knowledge, skills, and options for self-management of services. Activated patients have been found to achieve better clinical outcomes than patients with similar characteristics who were not 'activated.' [16] [17]"}

It generally involves deriving a rank or hierarchy of scores (values that are measured or calculated but are not entirely arbitrary) for categories of concern (such as tasks, costs, or other attributes). Different options that share these features can be compared using their performance in the different categories in a spreadsheet to determine the best option. For example, determining what method to use to inform patients of post-operative appoints may involve a decision of three options, such as sending a letter through regular mail, sending a text message, or calling by telephone. The categories of concern may include cost, time, and likelihood of receipt. The categories can be given weights of importance, and the options can be ranked according to their overall score across all three categories.", "contents": "Standards and Evaluation of Healthcare Quality, Safety, and Person-Centered Care -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes -- Reaching Consensus And Prioritizing Efforts At Quality Improvement.

In VSM, sub-processes of a larger overall process are assigned weighted values based on relative levels of importance, and which are summed into a final score called a criticality index that determines which process is the most critical for concentrating effort and devoting resources. Common components of a criticality index are: The frequency of the problem (how often during iterations a particular activity/task/issue occurs on a critical path), The severity of the problem, if or when it occurs, and The ease of detection of the problem early on before it becomes unmanageable.", "contents": "Standards and Evaluation of Healthcare Quality, Safety, and Person-Centered Care -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes -- Reaching Consensus And Prioritizing Efforts At Quality Improvement.

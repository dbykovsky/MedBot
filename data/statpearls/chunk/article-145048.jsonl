In myopia correction, corneal tissue is removed centrally to flatten the cornea, increase its focal length, and allow light rays to converge on the retina. In hyperopia correction, corneal tissue is removed peripherally to steepen the cornea, reduce its focal length, and focus light rays on the retina. Astigmatism correction alters the\u00a0corneal shape\u00a0to eliminate irregularities\u00a0and adjust the focal length in different meridians.

An endoscope is a rigid or flexible tube with a camera attached at one end. The focal length of the endoscopic camera lens determines the distance over which objects in the field of view remain in sharp focus. A shorter focal length results in a shallower depth of field; objects beyond this depth appear blurred. A longer focal length provides a greater depth of field,\u00a0and a larger range of distances\u00a0can be captured in sharp focus. The focal length of the endoscopic lens is adjustable; the chosen focal length is dictated by the procedure being performed and the anatomy being examined. Some endoscopes have a \"near-focus\" mode and a \"traditional\" mode to vary the size and clarity of the visual field. For example, during gastrointestinal endoscopy, a shorter focal length may be preferred to examine mucosal details closely. In contrast, during bronchoscopy, a longer focal length may be more suitable for visualizing deeper structures of the pulmonary tree.

When the x-ray source is closer to the image receptor, the focal length is shorter, resulting in increased image magnification. Conversely, a longer focal length leads to reduced magnification. The size of the focal spot, the area on the x-ray tube from where x-rays are emitted, is another important consideration related to focal length in radiography. A smaller focal spot size allows for improved spatial resolution and finer detail in the radiographic image.

Surgical treatment is typically recommended for extra-articular fractures when they are associated with an open wound which requires irrigation and excisional debridement to prevent osteomyelitis, instability which if left would lead to deformity (including angular, rotational, and shortening) or decreased hand function, and in cases of multiple displaced hand fractures. [12] [13] Transverse extra-articular fractures are typically stabilized with closed reduction and percutaneous pinning with the use of Kirschner wires\u00a0or open reduction with internal fixation. [6] [8] [11] [12] [14] [15] The use of percutaneous pinning usually has the advantage of limited soft tissue disturbance but also carries the disadvantage of usually requiring a period of immobilization to augment construct stability. Different techniques for percutaneous pinnings, such as parallel pinning,\u00a0cross pinning,\u00a0and transverse pinning, have been described and used in various fracture patterns.

For example, cystosarcoma phyllodes tumors are not evaluated with sentinel lymph node biopsy. In patients with invasive ductal and lobular carcinomas, T1 and T2 lesions, merit consideration considered for sentinel lymph node biopsy. The exception to this is if preoperative imaging, either ultrasound, mammogram, or MRI, shows evidence of possible lymph node enlargement.

Some advocate for a complete axillary dissection if two or more axillary nodes are positive for malignancy. [2] Some studies have found preoperative axillary imaging to be unhelpful in patients without palpable lymph nodes.

[3] The decision about whether or not to obtain preoperative imaging rests with the clinician. PET scan has been used preoperatively in some settings, and evidence suggests that a PET scan showing axillary involvement is a good indication for a complete axillary lymph node dissection, while a negative PET does not rule out lymph node involvement and should trigger sentinel node biopsy.

The mortality rate is higher in oliguric patients than in non-oliguric patients signifying the amount of damage done leading to necrosis. Mortality is high (about\u00a060%) in sepsis and surgical patients, causing multiple organ failure. Despite aggressive treatment, some patients may end up with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. [15] [16]", "contents": "Acute Renal Tubular Necrosis -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes. The diagnosis and management of ATN are best done with an interprofessional team that includes a nephrologist, pharmacist, internist, cardiologist, and intensivist.\u00a0The mainstay of management is the prevention of acute tubular necrosis by identifying the patients undergoing high-risk procedures and having comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, heart failure, advanced malignancy, atherosclerosis, and\u00a0CKD that can potentiate the effects of acute tubular necrosis. ATN is not a benign disorder, and the outcomes depend on the cause.\u00a0Factors that lead to poor survival in such patients include oliguria, poor nutritional status, male gender, the\u00a0need for mechanical\u00a0ventilation, stroke, seizures, and acute myocardial infarction.

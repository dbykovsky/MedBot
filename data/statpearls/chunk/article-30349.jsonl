Qualitative urine immunoassays (urine drug screens) for amphetamines\u00a0should\u00a0not guide the clinical management of patients. The major limitation of\u00a0amphetamine immunoassays\u00a0is the high rate of false positives and false negatives. An actual positive result means that the patient used a certain amphetamine within the past several days and\u00a0did not distinguish acute or recent use. The\u00a0gold standard of drug testing, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, may misidentify isomeric substances such as l -methamphetamine (present in nasal inhalers) versus d -methamphetamine. Xenobiotics that cause false-positive qualitative amphetamine screens include pseudoephedrine, L-ephedrine, procainamide, mexiletine, selegiline, bupropion, trazodone, and amantadine. Xenobiotics known to cause false negatives include MDMA\u00a0and cathinones."}

Teamwork is paramount to anesthesia crisis resource management, especially when it relies on multidisciplinary decision-making.\u00a0In response to the institute of medicine's report, to err is human, as well as the public demand for improvement in patient safety, the agency for healthcare research and quality (AHRQ) and the department of defense (DOD) have developed a curriculum dubbed TeamSTEPPS (team strategies & tools to enhance performance and patient safety) in 2006. [61] Based on several years of research into teamwork as it pertains to healthcare workers, TeamSTEPPS can be likened to a meta-analysis, put into practice. Teamwork, knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) such as closed-loop communication, shared mental models, and adaptability are among several included in the building blocks of TeamSTEPPS. [61] Weller et al. coded different aspects of team-focused communications and studied how communication differs between simulated events and actual practice in real clinical scenarios in the operating room (OR). [62] They showed no significant difference in the quality of communication during simulated vs. real routine events, however, observed that significantly less and lower quality communication occurred during real OR crises vs. simulated crisis events. This only strengthens the case that simulation is a practical tool for practicing teamwork and communication, not only for anesthesiology training but also can be used widely in other specialties."}

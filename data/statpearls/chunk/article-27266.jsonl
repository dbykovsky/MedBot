These include angiopoietin-2, which is responsible for chorionic villi vascular remodeling, leptin, which is responsible for the regulation of nutrient transfer, as well as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3, tissue inhibitor matrix metalloprotease-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and angiostatin.

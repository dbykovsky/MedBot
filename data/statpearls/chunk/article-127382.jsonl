Detrusor overactivity and incontinence were prevented while bowel function, erectile activity, and a normal bladder capacity were maintained. [78] [79] [80] However, despite these promising outcomes, the early use of sacral neuromodulation to alter the course of spinal cord injury and preserve bladder function is still considered investigational.

By making the field of view smaller and using a split diaphragm, scattered radiation can be reduced, thereby decreasing the exposure to the surgeon's hand. Distance is the most effective method to reduce exposure as exposure is decreased exponentially with distance. For all personnel with the risk of regular exposure to ionizing radiation, the use of dosimeters must be made mandatory. Real-time dosimeters allow for direct visualization of the radiation dose, which will help increase awareness regarding radiation hazards in personnel.", "contents": "Fluoroscopy Orthopedic Assessment, Protocols, and Interpretation -- Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions -- Team Safety Protocol.

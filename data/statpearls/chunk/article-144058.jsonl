As with the rule of astigmatism, horizontally oval mires are seen. As against the rule of astigmatism, vertically oval mires are seen. In oblique astigmatism, the principal meridian lies between 30\u00a0and 60 degrees and 120\u00a0and 150 degrees. The irregular anterior corneal surface has irregular mires and a doubling of mires.

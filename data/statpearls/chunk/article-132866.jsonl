Compared to stenotic valvulopathy, the regurgitant valvular disease is generally well tolerated during pregnancy; the combination of increased plasma volume with diminished systemic vascular resistance improves cardiac output. [2] Therefore, mitral and aortic regurgitation can actually improve during pregnancy. Unlike aortic stenosis, emphasis is placed on avoiding significant increases in systemic vascular resistance. Neuraxial anesthesia is\u00a0an excellent choice amongst this population due to further reductions in afterload.\u00a0 Bradycardia should be avoided as it can worsen regurgitation. [1]"}

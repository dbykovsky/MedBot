{"id": "article-28529_41", "title": "Open Rhinoplasty -- Technique or Treatment", "content": "Opening the nose: The open approach to the nose involves making a mid-columellar inverted-V incision, placement of which should be where the underlying cartilage is closest to the skin to avoid scar visibility and contracture. With the help of skin hooks and sharp dissection (e.g., Converse scissors), the mid-columellar incision is transitioned to the marginal incisions, taking care to avoid injury to the medial and lateral crura. The soft tissue envelope is further reflected superiorly in a relatively avascular supra-perichondrial plane to expose the upper lateral cartilages (ULC). At this point, dissection over the ULC is transitioned to a sub-perichondrial plane using sharp dissection. A periosteal elevator (e.g., Joseph elevator) is then used elevate the periosteum over the nasal bones up to the nasofrontal angle.

Pulmonary atresia with the intact ventricular septum (PA-IVS) is a rare and complex form of congenital heart defect with a broad spectrum of presentation. An insult during sensitive stages of embryological development is proposed to lead to PA-IVS.

The team most often includes a pediatric cardiologist, a cardiothoracic surgeon, an obstetrician, a maternal-fetal specialist (fetal diagnosis), a neonatal-perinatal specialist, neonatal and ICU nurses, and a cardiac intensivist. In patients diagnosed prenatally, it is imperative to have a management plan even before the baby is delivered. In individual cases, it is not unreasonable to consider delivering the neonate in a tertiary care center, where pediatric cardiothoracic surgical services are available. Every attempt should be made to prevent the delivery of the neonate during weekends and holidays when hospitals are not at full staffing.", "contents": "Pulmonary Atresia With Intact Ventricular Septum -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

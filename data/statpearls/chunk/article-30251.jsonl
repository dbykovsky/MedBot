TORS can result in significant pain and dysphagia postoperatively, particularly in advanced disease. Radiotherapy frequently causes mucositis, xerostomia, and skin reactions, which can also have a significant impact on swallowing. [32] These effects can be amplified in those who undergo TORS resection with post-operative chemo-radiotherapy, who have reported significantly worse swallowing and quality of life outcomes compared to those undergoing single modality treatments.

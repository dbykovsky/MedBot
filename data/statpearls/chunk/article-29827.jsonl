[58] [59] A recent systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated a clinical improvement rate of 86.8% in the posterior fossa decompression with duraplasty group compared to 69.8% in the posterior fossa decompression cohort. Medullary decompression and occipital-cervical sagittal realignment have shown resolution of syringomyelia. [60] Foramen magnum decompression with dural patch grafting has exhibited better functional outcomes than dural dissection. Recent meta-analyses highlight the superiority of autologous grafts over non-autologous options in terms of complications. [30] Dura splitting decompression is comparable to posterior fossa decompression with duraplasty in terms of clinical improvement while significantly reducing operative time, hospital stay duration, and CSF-related complications such as CSF leak, meningitis, and pseudomeningocele.

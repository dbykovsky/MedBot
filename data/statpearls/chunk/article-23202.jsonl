Other indications include calciphylaxis, refractory pruritus, severe hypercalcemia (serum calcium greater than 10.2 mg/dL) or hyperphosphatemia (serum phosphorus greater than 5.5 mg/dL), anemia hyporesponsive to erythropoietin, PTH levels more than 800 pg/mL (for more than 6 months despite medical therapy) and extraskeletal calcification. [6] [34] The parathyroid glands in secondary hyperparathyroidism are characterized by asymmetric enlargement and nodular hyperplasia. Assessment of parathyroid mass is an important factor in predicting the response to medical management. Glands\u00a0larger than 1 cm in size or greater than 500 mm^3 ) on ultrasound represent glandular hyperplasia and are usually refractory to medical treatment.

This position opacifies the cavity from the basal part up to the apex, does not hinder the mitral subvalvular apparatus, and causes little ventricular ectopic activity. Thirty degrees right oblique and 60 degrees left anterior oblique are the most commonly used views. The right anterior oblique view is cheaper and uses less radiation, and thus, is more commonly used. Various geometric methods have been developed that help in determining LVEF. These methods are based on determining ventricular volumes using mathematical models that assume that the ventricular cavity is symmetrical. Initially, ESV and EDV are calculated, which later help in determining the LVEF. The disk method (Simpson\u2019s rule) and the Dodge-Sandler area-length method are the most commonly used mathematical methods. Dodge-Sandler area-length method is the most commonly used method because LV in the 30 degrees right anterior oblique view and 60 degrees left anterior oblique view resembles an ellipse. This makes the longitudinal axis of the ventricular cavity to coincide with the longitudinal axis of this shape. Ventricular volume is obtained by calculating the volume of the ellipsoid."}

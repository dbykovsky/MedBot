The QRS complex originates above the AV node and not at the right or left ventricle, and due to this, it presents as a right bundle branch block (RBBB) or left bundle branch block (LBBB). [2] This occurs because the refractory period of the myocardium is proportional to the length of the prior RR interval. A shorter RR is associated with a shorter action potential duration and vice versa. With a longer RR cycle, there is an increase in the refractory period, and if a short RR follows, the beat that terminates the cycle is likely to be conducted aberrantly. [3] Because the refractory period of the right bundle is\u00a0longer than that of the left bundle, the right bundle remains in the refractory period when the supraventricular beat gets to the\u00a0His-Purkinje system. This results in the blocked conduction through\u00a01 bundle, leading to an electrocardiogram with bundle branch block\u00a0morphology. Since the refractory period of the right bundle branch is longer than the left bundle branch block, a right bundle branch block pattern\u00a0is more common, but a left bundle branch pattern can still be seen just less frequently.

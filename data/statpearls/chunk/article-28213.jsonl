To give perspective, the RNC effective dose is 0.0024 mSv, which is nearly ten times lower than that of a posterior-anterior (PA) chest radiograph, which is approximately 0.02 mSv. [16] The mean effective dose for MCU ranges from 0.03 to 0.4 mSv. [17] Novel modalities such as contrast-enhanced voiding urosonography (ceVUS) have the advantage of not requiring ionizing radiation. [18] Rather, ceVUS utilizes high-frequency sound waves (ultrasound) combined with a sonographic contrast agent to obtain high-quality images of the bladder, urethra, and ureters. However, this technique may be difficult to perform in certain uncommon pathologic conditions, is technique-dependent, and subject to limitations by overlying bowel gas, which can hamper ultrasound transmission.

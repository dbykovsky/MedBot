The entry point is marked at\u00a0the posterior one-third of the spinal canal, approximately 2-5 mm anterior to the spinolaminar line and 4-6 mm inferior to the arch of C1.\u00a0After area sterilization and application of local anesthesia, a 20 or 22-gauge long spinal needle is entered at the skin at the puncture site. The needle is advanced under intermittent fluoroscopic guidance with the bevel facing dorsally. An anteroposterior image is obtained to check the needle position. When the needle is up to a few millimeters of the medial border of the ipsilateral lateral mass of C1, the stylet is removed to check for CSF return. Dural tenting is expected, and CSF return may not happen until the needle is past the midline. Venous blood is commonly encountered as the needle enters the epidural venous plexus."}

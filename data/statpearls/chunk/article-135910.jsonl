While the general surgeon is almost always involved in the care of patients subjected to surgical resection of the lesion in UCD, it is essential to consult with an interprofessional team of specialists, including an anesthesiologist, oncologist, and vascular surgeon. The nurses are also vital members of the interprofessional group as they will monitor the patient's vital signs and assist with the education of the patient and family. The pharmacist will ensure that the patient is on the appropriate analgesics, antiemetics, and appropriate antibiotics for pain and wound infection in the postoperative period.", "contents": "Castleman Disease -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

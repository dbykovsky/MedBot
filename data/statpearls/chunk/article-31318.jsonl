In medicine, weight-bearing is of importance in patients who are on the orthopedic floor. Following surgery to fix fractures or repair torn ligaments or tendons, the amount of weight-bearing prescribed depends on the type of surgery. In some cases, the surgeon will prescribe some weight-bearing exercise until the incision heals. In other instances, weight-bearing may be partial and then progressed to full over weeks. Almost any exercise is an option for weight-bearing. In hospitalized patients who undergo repair of fractures, weight-bearing is initially limited due to ambulation. As the muscle strength returns and the range of motion improves, full weight-bearing may take place by controlled exercises performed with the help of a physical therapist.", "contents": "Weight Bearing -- Definition/Introduction.

The weight-bearing load can increase through the use of weights; this is extremely beneficial for people with osteoporosis, athletes who submit their bones to tremendous stresses, or women that are postmenopausal and have lower estrogen levels leading to poor bone development. An effective way to stimulate osteogenesis in osteoporotic patients is through physical exercise. [1] Regular weight-bearing, along with vitamin supplementation, is the cornerstone for fracture prevention in these patients. [2] On the other hand, two exercises that involve limiting weight-bearing include cycling and swimming. These exercises help increase the range of motion and improve muscle mass, but they are not very effective in weight-bearing exercises. Athletes who are swimmers or cyclers tend to have lower bone mineral density than other athletes.

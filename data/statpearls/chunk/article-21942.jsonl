As discussed previously, Foville syndrome has various etiologies, though the most common is arterial vascular disease. The treatment approach is similar to other acute strokes, depending on the presentation time. Thrombolytic therapy is generally indicated for patients presenting within 4.5 hours from\u00a0symptom onset or the last known normal time. Endovascular treatments usually are not\u00a0recommended for small-vessel ischemic disease."}

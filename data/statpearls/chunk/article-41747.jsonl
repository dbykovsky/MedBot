Given that line of reasoning, it should be no surprise that in the Great Conversation ,\u00a0regarding medical ethics, the concept \u201cfirst\u00a0do no harm\u201d\u00a0is a relatively late entry. American physician Elisha Bartlett (1804-1855), who studied medicine in Paris, says that French pathologist Auguste Francois Chomel (1788-1858) invented that saying (Hooker W. Physician and Patient . Baker and Scribner; 1847. 219). The Hippocratic Oath and other ancient medical texts prescribed doing good before avoiding harm. The Hippocratic Oath\u2019s statement, \u201cI will use treatment to help the sick according to my ability and judgment,\u201d\u00a0precedes the oath\u2019s discussion on avoiding harm."}

Ethics and medicine function as complementary approaches for enhancing human life. A student of the medical sciences cannot attain mastery in medicine if they can only identify the proper treatment based on instructions from others and cannot reference any other standard. Similarly, comprehending the rationale behind using a specific standard to discern the proper basis for decision-making is necessary to achieve mastery in ethics. Healthcare professionals and others engaged in the healthcare industry must prioritize ethical principles."}

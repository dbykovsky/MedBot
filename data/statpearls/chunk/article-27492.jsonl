[12] The thyroarytenoid muscle uniquely functions as independent superior and inferior portions, allowing for intricate alterations in sound intensity and quality through relaxation of the vocal ligaments. [12] The distance between the thyroid and cricoid cartilages is narrowed by the cricothyroid, thyroarytenoid, and vocalis muscles, tensing/stretching the true vocal cords foto increasehe pitch of phonation. [12] The vocalis muscle modules the pitch of phonation by simultaneously tensing and relaxing the anterior and posterior aspects of the vocal ligaments, respectively. Vocalis muscles alter the tone of phonation via alterations in the mass of the vocal folds. \u00a0The diameter of the laryngeal inlet is controlled by the thyroepiglottic, aryepiglottic, and oblique arytenoid muscles; contraction of former muscle causes opening of the inlet, while the latter muscles are responsible for closing the inlet."}

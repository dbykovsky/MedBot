The patellar tendon reflex is elicited by stimulating the patella tendon, classically by a reflex hammer, located inferior to the patella. The stimulation stretches muscle spindles located in the quadriceps muscles, and this muscle spindle stretch excites afferent sensory neurons that innervate the muscle spindles. These afferent sensory neurons then synapse on alpha motor neurons located in the anterior horn area of the spinal cord. [9] The alpha motor neurons then stimulate the quadriceps muscle to contract, producing the reflex response of the quadriceps muscle. The reflex is mediated by the femoral nerve, originating at the L2-L4 level of the spinal cord. It is a monosynaptic reflex because only one synapse produces the reflex response between the afferent sensory neuron and the efferent motor neuron.

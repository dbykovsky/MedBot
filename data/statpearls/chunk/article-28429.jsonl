In addition to the legs, some patients may start to experience the same symptoms in the arms. Overall, the symptoms are less severe in the morning and get worse during the evening and night. In some patients, the symptoms are so severe that they are disabling, interrupting sleep, and causing daytime fatigue. Studies show that restless leg patients are prone to hypertension, headaches, and sleep difficulties. The quality of life for most patients is poor. By age 50 years, RLS usually\u00a0worsens and causes\u00a0daily disruption of sleep, resulting in decreased daytime alertness. RLS is associated with poor quality of life. [24] [25]"}

These diagnostic tests can also help distinguish between new and old nerve damage and support the presence of demyelination at a nerve level leading to a conduction block. [1] EMG can provide physiological information that can aid in diagnosis alongside the anatomical information given by an MRI. EMG also provides evidence of direct denervation when there are uncertain motor deficits or no motor deficits. EMG is beneficial in helping to determine if denervation is either chronic\u00a0or currently ongoing.\u00a0An example of this would be patients who have undergone previous spinal surgery but continue to have significant radicular back pain following surgery.

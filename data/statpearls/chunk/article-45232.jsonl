[1] Carotid-cavernous fistulas\u00a0are typically divided into four subtypes, defined by etiology and nature of the lesion. Direct (Barrow A) lesions involve an endothelial tear of the carotid itself, while indirect lesions (Barrow B, C, or D) involve small branches of the internal or external carotid systems. While 10 to 60% of CCFs may spontaneously resolve, and up to an additional 30% of low-flow CCFs may resolve with conservative management (carotid compression therapy), many progressive lesions require intervention. [2] Direct lesions are amenable to endoarterial treatment. Indirect lesions are appropriately treated with transvenous embolization; the ipsilateral inferior petrosal sinus (IPS) is the preferred route. Initial reports characterized case series in which the SOV route was utilized when traditional access through the IPS failed. Typically, the SOV can be accessed through the facial-angular venous system. However, cases exist in which stenosis, hypoplasia, or tortuosity of the vessels prevent safe transvenous access via this route.

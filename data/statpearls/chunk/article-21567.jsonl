The level of dissection can lie either within the deep plane (sub-SMAS/sub-platysmal) or in a subcutaneous plane\u00a0with attention to facial nerve landmarks. Some authors prefer the deep plane technique for patients at risk for poor healing and/or skin necrosis (e.g., smokers, malnourished, diabetes, vasculopathy, etc.)."}

With respect to surgery, hematomas and seromas are common in the early postoperative period, especially in hypertensive patients and patients on anticoagulants. Males are also at an increased risk of hematoma development because of the increased dermal blood flow associated with hair follicles. Over resection of fat in the submental area can result in a so-called \"cobra neck\" deformity, and excessive tension at closure can pull the ear lobe inferiorly into a \"pixie ear\" deformity, both of which can be avoided with a more conservative surgical technique.", "contents": "Neck Rejuvenation -- Complications.

Great auricular nerve injury leaves the inferior aspect of the pinna hyperesthetic, and marginal mandibular branch injury causes an asymmetric smile, because the lower lip depressors become weak. The uninjured side of the upper lip will depress normally, leaving the affected side higher up and causing an overall crooked appearance. Other standard risks apply as well, such as may occur with any other surgery: pain, bleeding, infection, scarring, alopecia, and need for further surgery.", "contents": "Neck Rejuvenation -- Complications.

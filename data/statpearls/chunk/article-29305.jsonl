Neuraxial anesthesia offers many benefits that are not available with general anesthesia. Neuraxial anesthesia has made it possible to perform many major procedures on an awake patient. For example, cesarian sections can be better and safely performed via neuraxial anesthesia than with general anesthesia, which allows the establishment of bonding between a mother and her neonate to take place immediately."}

The use of thoracic epidurals as a postoperative pain modality in post-thoracotomy patients has helped to improve patient's respiratory status. Other beneficial effects are better pain control than intravenous narcotics, less need for systemic opioids, earlier recovery of bowel functions, and easier participation in physical therapy.", "contents": "Spinal Anesthesia -- Clinical Significance.

Anterior segment examination: the presence of iris neovascularization should raise suspicion of ischemic CRVO Fundus evaluation: helps to identify underlying causes such as optic neuropathy (optic neuritis, ischemic optic neuropathy), retinal detachment, retinal vascular occlusion, glaucoma, and others.

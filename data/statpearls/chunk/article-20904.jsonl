Such activity is rarely documented earlier than 33 to 34 weeks of conception age; with increasing maturity of the neonatal brain, the ability to initiate and sustain seizure activity seems apparent. Another term, BIRDs (brief ictal rhythmic discharges), has been used to describe the rhythmic ictal activity of less than 10 seconds duration. Ictal rhythms are generally\u00a0focal in onset, can arise in more than one region, tend to\u00a0spread as the seizure evolves, often to one hemisphere, or may become generalized. The morphology of the discharge can change during a seizure, which helps differentiate it from monomorphic rhythmic patterns that may arise from artifacts. Specialized forms of focal discharges such as lateralized periodic\u00a0discharges (LPDs) may be seen in neonates and have been described in association with herpes simplex encephalitis, and focal ischemic strokes, and have sometimes been considered indicative of seizures in a depressed brain."}

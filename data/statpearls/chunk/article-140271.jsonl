A few variations of UGH syndrome are recognized, including UGH plus and IPUGH (incomplete posterior UGH) syndrome. UGH plus includes vitreous hemorrhage, with UGH seen in anterior chamber lenses with iris support posterior chamber lenses placed in the sulcus or the capsular bag. [35] Communication between the vitreous cavity and the anterior chamber through the anterior hyaloid face, whose integrity is disrupted after surgery, occurs spontaneously or due to degenerative changes; this causes the passage of blood and gives rise to the simultaneous bleed in both the anterior chamber and the vitreous cavity. IPUGH syndrome is bleeding into the posterior chamber (usually between the IOL and the posterior capsule, similar to endocapsular hematoma or 'in-the-bag hyphema') without uveitis. Some cases of IPUGH syndrome may have glaucoma. [53]"}

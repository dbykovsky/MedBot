Although there is no data available on the use of cenegermin in pregnant women, animal studies indicate no evidence of direct or indirect harmful effects on reproductive toxicity. Similarly, there is no data on the impact of cenegermin therapy on human fertility. Despite administering the drug to male and female rats in a daily subcutaneous dosage equivalent to 1709 times the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose (MRHOD),\u00a0cenegermin did not impact their fertility parameters. According to the drug's label, administering the medication subcutaneously or ocularly to female rats resulted in ovarian issues such as follicular cysts, persistent estrus, changes in ovarian weight, and a decreased corpora lutea. These effects were observed when the dosage was equal to or greater than 119 times the MRHOD."}

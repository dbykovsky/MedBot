Before the 1990s, most orthopedists managing a patient with TEV used the method described by Hiram Kite. However, Ignacio Ponseti developed a new way of non-operative management, which became widely popular in the 1990s. The success of the Ponseti method has been reported at greater than 90 percent in multiple studies. The Ponseti process involves serial manipulation and casting of the affected limb(s). The molding should not be forceful or painful. The clinician spends about one minute manipulating the foot before casting. The affected limb is cast with weekly cast changes. Initially, the cast is placed with the forefoot supinated. The goal is to align the forefoot and hindfoot with the first metatarsal dorsiflexion. Subsequent casts are placed with gradual forefoot abduction around the talar head. Casting will also bring the calcaneus into valgus or eversion. Typically, after 3-4 casts, the only remaining deformity will be equinus, which is addressed by casting in gradual dorsiflexion. Scher states that percutaneous Achilles tenotomy is required in 80%-90% of cases to correct equinus.

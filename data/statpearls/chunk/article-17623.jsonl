Expanding access to healthcare is essential to prevent complications of anal abscess as untreated abscesses are more likely to result in a fistula. Educating patients on proper hygiene and skincare of the perianal region, such as showering daily and washing when soiled, may also help prevent this morbid condition.", "contents": "Anorectal Fistula -- Deterrence and Patient Education.

Educating patients preoperatively may aid in decision making to manage post-operative expectations. General Surgeons see and manage the majority of patients with anal fistula; however, involving a colorectal surgeon in complex cases is essential as they are trained more specifically in these conditions than the general surgeon. For example, ACGME requirements for graduation of general surgery residents only require a total of 20 anorectal procedures, however, accredited colorectal surgery fellowships require a total of 60 anorectal procedures including 20 fistula procedures.", "contents": "Anorectal Fistula -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

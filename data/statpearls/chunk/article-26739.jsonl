[3] They also showed that the age of disease onset did not affect the strength of the pathergy reaction. Another study indicated that although the results of the pathergy test had no association with any particular disease manifestation or with disease activity, the prevalence of positive pathergy tests was lower in milder cases of BD. It has also been shown that BD patients were more likely to have a positive test if they were not taking their medications for the disease at the time of testing. [1] Further investigations are still required to determine how various factors influence pathergy so that pathergy testing can be more refined to maximize sensitivity.", "contents": "Pathergy Test -- Interfering Factors. Another possible interfering factor with pathergy testing is thought to be the use of corticosteroids by BD patients, which can increase the false-negative results according to some studies. [12] However, other researchers have demonstrated that systemic corticosteroid use did not alter the histology or the gross appearance of the pathergy test. Several groups have also found that the pathergy test is more strongly positive among male patients compared to female patients of similar age.

{"id": "article-26739_17", "title": "Pathergy Test -- Complications", "content": "There have been no serious reported complications of the oral or skin pathergy test in BD patients. The papules and pustules that result from the skin prick usually become maximum in 48 hours and disappear within 45 days. [6] Therefore, pathergy testing itself is considered relatively harmless and does not cause any known adverse effects. However, the disruption of tissue integrity that triggers an exaggerated inflammatory response characteristic of the pathergy phenomenon has been associated with numerous complications in BD. In particular, eye inflammation following intraocular corticosteroid injections, superficial thrombophlebitis induced by venipuncture, aneurysm formation after angiographic interventions, lesions after vascular surgeries, and anastomotic ulcers following bowel resections are all well-known examples of adverse pathergy reactions in various tissue sites of BD patients. [3] The actual incidences of these known complications and their correlation with positive SPT have not been well established and merit future research efforts.", "contents": "Pathergy Test -- Complications.

Surgical debridement of PG ulcers has occasionally resulted in the rapid progression of the ulcers with an exponential increase in size. [1] There have also been reports of procedures such as venipuncture and intravenous line placement inducing new PG lesions in pathergy-like reactions. Thus, it is crucial to be aware of such complications related to pathergy in patients so that clinicians may minimize interventions that have the possibility of worsening their condition. Other studies have shown a positive pathergy test to be an independent risk factor for postoperative complications in patients with BD. [6] Surgical intervention may be required at times for BD when, for example, patients manifest ischemia from thromboembolism or have an impending aneurysm rupture. Under these circumstances, a positive pathergy test can help identify subgroups of patients at higher risk of postoperative complications and in guiding the initiation of immunosuppressive treatments in such patients.", "contents": "Pathergy Test -- Complications.

Despite the loss in sensitivity, the test has demonstrated improvements in its diagnostic odds ratio, positive predictive value, and positive likelihood ratio. [12] Pathergy test is a crucial component of 12 of the 16 different sets of criteria used in the diagnosis of BD. Without its use, sensitivity and accuracy of diagnosis decrease, demonstrating that pathergy testing improves the power of existing diagnostic criteria.

Therefore, it is quite powerful in resolving various diagnostic dilemmas for diseases that may have a similar initial presentation.", "contents": "Pathergy Test -- Clinical Significance.

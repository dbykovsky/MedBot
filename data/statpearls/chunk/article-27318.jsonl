A standard blood transfusion set with an inline filter of 170 to 260 microns is used. A transfusion rate of 2 to 5 ml/min is used, thereby completing the transfusion in 1 to 2 hours. Slower flow rates are used in patients at risk of fluid overload. The patient is closely monitored during the transfusion, with the vitals recorded every 15 minutes.

Antigen present on donor white cells binds to the antibody in the recipient, which leads to pyrogen and cytokine release, such as TNF-alpha, IL1, and IL6.

FNHTR is diagnosed with the above-mentioned features, and the possibility of chills and hemolytic causes are ruled out by further immunohematology workup and lab findings.

Patients can be exposed to nerve agents through agriculture and bioterrorism. Organophosphates and carbamates found in many insecticides commonly cause toxicity in agricultural and industrial workers. Synthetic nerve agents like soman, tabun, sarin, and VX have been used in bioterrorism in the past and present. Soman is a volatile liquid nerve agent originally developed by the Germans in World War II but was never used in warfare. VX is a synthetic nonvolatile liquid nerve agent and was most famously used recently in the assassination of Kim Jong Un's half-brother Kim Jong Nam in February of 2017. The Germans also synthesized tabun in World War II, and during the Nuremberg trials post-war, a military officer admitted to conspiring to assassinate Adolf Hitler in his bunker with Tabun. Sarin is highly volatile, and death from respiratory paralysis can occur in as little as 1 to 10 minutes. Sarin was used in the 1995 Tokyo subway attack killing 12 people [1] .", "contents": "Nerve Agents -- Etiology. The etiology of nerve agent toxicity is primarily environmental exposure.

Nerve agents bind and phosphorylate acetylcholinesterase (AChE) which leads to inactivation of the enzyme and excess amounts of acetylcholine (ACh) in the neuromuscular junction. Excessive ACh leads to constant depolarization of the postsynaptic neurons which causes the symptoms of cholinergic and muscarinic toxicity. Until the new AChE is synthesized or an oxime like pralidoxime is used to displace the organophosphate from AChE, ACh will persist in the neuromuscular junction constantly binding the muscarinic and nicotinic receptors leading to the signs and symptoms of cholinergic excess. Following the initial phosphorylation, a conformational change, known as \u2018aging,' may occur where an alkoxy group leaves the phosphorylated enzyme. The aging process is clinically important when it comes to the quick recognition of symptoms and treatment with oximes. Once AChE has aged, it cannot be reactivated by the use of oximes. Aging is variable between nerve agents.

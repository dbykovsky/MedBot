One organization evaluated the use of evidence-based practice in clinical practice after nurses attended a formal evidence-based practice course. [12] Nurses who attended the organization\u2019s EBP course were invited to participate in focus groups to provide additional qualitative data. Data from two focus groups highlighted the impact of the EBP course, areas for further development, and potential barriers to the use of EBP. The nurses indicated that the course changed their way of thinking and enhanced their patient care. They stated there was a need for mentoring and that time was a significant barrier to EBP. That information was used by organizational leadership to help identify areas needing consideration for educational offerings and support mechanisms."}

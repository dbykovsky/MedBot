This exposes the pars flaccida, a clear membrane that covers the caudate lobe and runs between the lesser curvature of the stomach and the liver. The right crus fibers should be visualized and distinguished from the inferior vena cava. This is superior to the left gastric artery and caudal to the gastroesophageal junction. The opening should be wide enough to pass a 5 mm laparoscopic dissector. Care must be taken to stay superior to the lesser sac; entering this space may lead to future complications. A laparoscopic dissector will then be bluntly placed through this opening and passed posterior to the stomach toward the angle of His. The dissector will then traverse the left gastrophrenic ligament at the angle of His with blunt dissection. The angle of His may be incised before this step at the physician's discretion."}

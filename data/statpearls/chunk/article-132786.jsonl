Most of the radiated tissue will continue to have residual endothelial damage and endarteritis obliterans in the long term. This is the main reason why any injury in any radiated tissue will be difficult to heal. Hyperbaric oxygen can improve the wound environment to stimulate healing. However, in extensive cases, surgical excision of the affected area and coverage by vascularized flap is the most suitable option.

A biopsy is essential for diagnosis, and further scans may also be needed to assess the systemic spread of the malignancy. The most common causes are basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, Marjolin ulcer, or secondary malignancies. Wide local excision of the tumor along with potential lymph node surgery is the treatment of choice. In extensive non-operable cases, electrochemotherapy may be used to limit the extension of the ulcer and to decrease pain and discharge.", "contents": "Complex Wound Management -- Clinical Significance -- Malignant Wounds.

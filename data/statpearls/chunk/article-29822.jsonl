The significant increase in congenital syphilis in the US has reached what the CDC calls \"alarming\" and \"dire\" levels, which require action from the entire medical community to address. One suggestion has been to implement syphilis testing of pregnant women in emergency departments, which is not typically done, as these areas focus on urgent needs and not screening for unrelated illnesses."}

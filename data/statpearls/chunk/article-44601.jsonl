Treatment often requires intubation, hemodynamic support with vasopressors, and maintaining body temperature with warmers, commonly in an intensive care unit (ICU) setting. In mild or early cases of toxicity, activated charcoal and alkaline diuresis have been added but show minimal benefits. Always contact poison control if poisoning or overdose is suspected.", "contents": "Pentobarbital -- Toxicity. Pediatric neurotoxicity\u00a0is reported with the use of pentobarbital.

As such, a thorough understanding of retroperitoneal anatomy is vital for surgery involving this area. Complications may arise from inadvertent damage to structures located within the retroperitoneum during surgical manipulation or instrumentation. [9] An important consideration in any surgical procedure is gaining access to and achieving proper exposure of the structures in the area of the operation. The Kocher maneuver is a technique that enables access to the retroperitoneum and visualization of structures such as the aorta, inferior vena cava, duodenum, and pancreas. It is performed by first identifying the duodenum, and then making an incision in the peritoneum along its immediate lateral (right) aspect, allowing the duodenum and head of the pancreas to be separated from their peritoneal attachments and reflected 180 degrees medially (to the patient's left) to gain access to retroperitoneal structures. [10] If greater exposure is required, the incision can then be extended caudally along the white line of Toldt, allowing the ascending colon to be reflected medially and more access to the more inferiorly lying retroperitoneal structures. This approach is known as an extended Kocher maneuver and is part of another more extensive technique called the Cattell-Braasch maneuver. It is performed with the steps outlined above with the addition of dissecting the small bowel mesentery cephalad to the Ligament of Treitz in an avascular plane along the inferior mesenteric vein which allows the entire right colon and small bowel to be swung medially out of the abdomen and complete exposure of the retroperitoneal structures.

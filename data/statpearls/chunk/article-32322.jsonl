Motility is produced in the ENS through a reflex circuit involving the circular and longitudinal muscles. Nicotinic synapses between interneurons mediate the reflex circuits. [39] When the circuit activates by the presence of a bolus, excitatory neurons in the circular muscle and inhibitory neurons in the longitudinal muscle fire producing a narrow section of bowel proximal to the bolus; this is known as the propulsive segment.

Most patients whose onset is before 20 years have a final visual acuity better than 20/80. Furthermore, the particular mtDNA mutation also influences prognosis, with the 11778 mutations carrying the worst prognosis for vision (only 4% reported spontaneous recovery) and the 14484 mutations the best (37% to 65% reported spontaneous recovery). The ultimate visual acuities in patients with the 14484 mutations are significantly better than those with the 11778 and 3460 mutations.

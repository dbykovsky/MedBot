Although infection is a relatively rare complication of syndactyly surgery, it has the potential to be devastating if not recognized and addressed promptly with surgical debridement or antibiotics. Recent data suggests a postoperative infection rate of 1.6%. Complications from the surgery are more likely to be present in patients with syndromic presentations and multiple preoperative medical diagnoses. [21] Another potential complication is scar formation and contracture. [5] This can be attributed to split-thickness skin graft use or growth of the surrounding bone. Full-thickness graft use is less associated with contracture and is preferred when possible for this reason. [22] Another common complication is web creep. Web creep is defined as the webspace migrating distally as the patient ages. This can lead to a progressive deformity in the hand. The patient's age during the operation may be an important factor concerning web creep. The patient should be followed at regular intervals after surgery to detect this complication at an early stage. Finally, devascularization of the digit or nerve injury can occur. Only\u00a01 side of the digit must be operated on at a time to ensure that the digit retains a functional digital artery. [2] [3] [4] [5] Devascularization may result in prolonged healing and recovery times or, in an extreme situation, create the potential need for amputation. In the setting of nerve injury, multiple techniques have been described to address digital nerve injury, including primary nerve repair, repair with nerve conduit, and nerve grafting. Digital nerve injury, even after repair, may result in loss of or diminished digital sensation. [23]", "contents": "Syndactyly -- Complications.

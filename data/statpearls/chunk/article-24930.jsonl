[43] [44] [45] Significant advances made in the last two decades with radiation therapy in BM as well as systemic therapy in melanoma has significantly improved the prognosis. One study enrolled 179 patients with BM secondary to melanoma who are subsequently treated with SRS and systemic therapy involving immunotherapy or targeted therapy. The one year and two-year OS were 50% and 27% respectively. [46] A variety of tools were developed for prognostication in individual melanoma patients. These include the Basic Score for Brain Metastases (BSBM), score index or radiosurgery in BM, and a diagnosis-specific graded prognostic assessment tool for patients with melanoma brain metastases.

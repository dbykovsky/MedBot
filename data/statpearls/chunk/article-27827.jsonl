When used as a vaginal suppository, it is indicated as an abortifacient from gestational week 12 to 20 or for the evacuation of uterine contents for the management of missed abortion and intrauterine fetal death up to 28 weeks. Prostaglandin E2 is also useful for the management of gestational trophoblastic disease. Importantly, it is not a feticidal agent. Given its oxytocic properties, the administration of dinoprostone should only be at the proper dosages by experienced clinicians. [2]", "contents": "Prostaglandin E2 (Dinoprostone) -- Indications.

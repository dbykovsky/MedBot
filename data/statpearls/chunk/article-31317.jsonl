It functions to bind coagulation factor VIII in the presence of vessel injury. vWF then cross-links the basement membrane collagen of the vessel to gp1b seen on platelets. This process of platelet adhesion is one of the first steps of clot formation and maturation. P-selectin plays a major role in the ability to increase the permeability of endothelial cells, permitting the components of the cell-mediated immune system (leukocytes) to roll, marginate, and enter the extracellular focus of inflammation.

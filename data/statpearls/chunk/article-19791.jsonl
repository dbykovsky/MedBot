The optimal approach to address these lesions is unclear. The DECISION-CTO trial showed the noninferiority of medical therapy compared to medical therapy along with PCI for death, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, and the need for repeat revascularization. [45] However, some studies have highlighted improved symptoms and a lower incidence of myocardial infarction using PCI. [46] Before approaching a CTO PCI, it is necessary to consider the lesion anatomy. Favorable outcomes of CTO PCI are associated with short CTO duration, shorter CTO length, absence of bridging adjacent to the occlusion, and a tapered stump at the proximal cap. The most challenging aspect of CTOs is accessing the distally occluded lesion; both antegrade and retrograde approaches can accomplish this. These highly specialized techniques necessitate using a specific guiding catheter, which may differ based on whether the lesion is in the right versus left coronary circulation. [47] Guidewire choice is also important. The most common approach is to initially utilize a polymer-coated floppy wire and escalate quickly based on physics to optimize tip load and support. These wires are less stiff and allow safer access to the CTO. Using a microcatheter can also support the guidewire when moving across the CTO. [48] A retrograde approach is reserved for CTO lesions that are not amenable to the antegrade approach. Other advanced techniques, such as laser and rotational atherectomy, have been utilized in CTOs to help create microchannels. However, atherectomy techniques are risky due to the risk of perforation\u00a0and dissection, especially in the false lumen, and are not routinely used. [49] CABG is another option for patients with CTO if there is viable myocardium and if multi-vessel disease is present. Bypassing the CTO is an essential aspect of revascularization. [50]", "contents": "Complex Coronary Artery Lesions -- Treatment / Management. Chronic total occlusions (CTO) - These lesions are the most challenging to treat. The optimal approach to address these lesions is unclear. The DECISION-CTO trial showed the noninferiority of medical therapy compared to medical therapy along with PCI for death, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, and the need for repeat revascularization. [45] However, some studies have highlighted improved symptoms and a lower incidence of myocardial infarction using PCI. [46] Before approaching a CTO PCI, it is necessary to consider the lesion anatomy. Favorable outcomes of CTO PCI are associated with short CTO duration, shorter CTO length, absence of bridging adjacent to the occlusion, and a tapered stump at the proximal cap. The most challenging aspect of CTOs is accessing the distally occluded lesion; both antegrade and retrograde approaches can accomplish this. These highly specialized techniques necessitate using a specific guiding catheter, which may differ based on whether the lesion is in the right versus left coronary circulation. [47] Guidewire choice is also important. The most common approach is to initially utilize a polymer-coated floppy wire and escalate quickly based on physics to optimize tip load and support. These wires are less stiff and allow safer access to the CTO. Using a microcatheter can also support the guidewire when moving across the CTO.

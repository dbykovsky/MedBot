The\u00a0main\u00a0purpose of this stratification is to help guide preoperative decisions, including surgical necessity and extent; however, trials are still underway to establish management recommendations for each risk group.

However, if\u00a0bevacizumab\u00a0is not used\u00a0during the primary treatment with chemotherapy, the NCCN does not recommend use for maintenance therapy. Additionally, anti-angiogenic inhibitors are not recommended in patients with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations\u00a0because other targeted therapies are\u00a0more effective. In patients with wild-type or an unknown BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation status, bevacizumab is still appropriate. [45] Conversely, ASCO is more conservative in its recommendation of\u00a0bevacizumab. Though bevacizumab significantly benefits progression-free survival when used as concurrent therapy followed by single-agent maintenance therapy, no clear clinical benefit in overall survival has\u00a0been demonstrated; therefore, ASCO merely suggests that it may\u00a0be considered\u00a0until more evidence is found. [37] Other angiogenesis inhibitors include pazopanib, sorafenib, sunitinib, cediranib, and aflibercept; however, these medications\u00a0are not frequently used\u00a0due to adverse effects or cost.

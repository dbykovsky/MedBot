This process can be explained through the Fick law of diffusion, in which the drug molecule moves according to the concentration gradient from a higher drug concentration to a lower concentration until equilibrium is reached. [4] Passive diffusion can occur in an aqueous or lipid environment. Aqueous diffusion occurs in the aqueous compartment of the body, such as interstitial space, or through aqueous pores in the endothelium of blood vessels. Drugs bound to albumin or large plasma proteins cannot permeate most aqueous pores. On the other hand, lipid diffusion occurs through the lipid compartment of the body. Therefore, it is considered the most critical factor for drug permeability due to the greater number of lipid barriers that separate the body's compartments. The lipid-aqueous partition coefficient of the drug can be used to determine how rapidly the drug moves between lipid and aqueous mediums.", "contents": "Drug Absorption -- Issues of Concern.

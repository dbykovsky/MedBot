Contact the lower lumbar region with the cephalad hand, so the finger pads are on the contralateral paraspinal muscles, and the thenar/hypothenar eminences are on the ipsilateral paraspinal muscles. Have the patient bend one or both knees and lift their pelvis off the table. Position the arm closest to the patient in-between the patient\u2019s legs and contact the sacrum, so the fingertips are at the sacral base, and the hands are perpendicular to each other. Have the patient relax their pelvis back down on the table. They can either keep their knees bent or straighten them out. Keeping the hand and wrist relaxed will help with palpation of the tissues while it is under the weight of the patient and improve provider ergonomics. To assess the motion of the sacrum on the ilia, induce nutation/counternutation on its transverse axes by flexing and extending the wrist and right/left rotation on its vertical axes by pronating and supinating the wrist of the hand that is under the sacrum."}

Assess the motion at the LS junction when the patient takes deep breaths. With an inhalation, the sacrum should go into counternutation, and the lumbar lordosis should flatten. With an exhalation, the sacrum should go into nutation, and the lumbar lordosis should increase. Assess whether adding compression or distraction to the LS junction creates more freedom of motion there. To add compression bring the caudad hand superiorly and the cephalad hand inferiorly. To add distraction, bring the caudad hand inferiorly and the cephalad hand superiorly. To treat, add compression or distraction, induce motion in all the planes tested in the sacrum, and add a rotation of the lumbar spine. Depending on whether direct or indirect BLT is used, the provider will first go into the direction of ease or restriction and then fine-tune to a point of balanced tension. Warmth, softening, increased motion, or a sensation that less force is needed to hold the joint in its treatment position might also be felt. Once this happens, subtle motions can be used to find the next point of balanced tension. Repeat this process until no further change is appreciated.

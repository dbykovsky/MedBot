[44] Unfortunately, no studies have directly compared the outcomes of different types and rates of fluid resuscitation. Currently, guidelines from the International Society of Nephrology renal disaster relief task force, recommend using isotonic saline rather than alkaline fluids in The field. The addition of dextrose to normal saline can be beneficial in supplying some calories and minimizing hyperkalemia. A rate of 1 L/h is given over 2 hours, followed by 500 ml/hr in a well-built adult. The rate of fluid administration is also dependent on age, gender, body habitus, the possibility of bleeding, and the nature of trauma. Potassium-containing IV fluids like Ringer's lactate are generally avoided in the management of rhabdomyolysis."}

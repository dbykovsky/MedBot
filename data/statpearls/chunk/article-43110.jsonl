Understanding the underlying causes of urinary tract pathologies is crucial for accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.", "contents": "Physiology, Urination -- Clinical Significance. Pathologies affecting the urinary tract system can result from both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. These conditions encompass a wide range of disorders, including neurological disorders, outlet obstruction, and infections. Neurological disorders can disrupt the normal coordination of bladder function, leading to issues such as urinary incontinence or retention. Outlet obstruction, often caused by conditions like an enlarged prostate in men or pelvic organ prolapse in women, can impede urine flow. Infections, which can be bacterial or viral, can affect various parts of the urinary tract, leading to infections or pyelonephritis. Understanding the underlying causes of urinary tract pathologies is crucial for accurate diagnosis and effective treatment."}

Adult diagnostic criteria require a heart rate increase\u00a0of greater than or equal to 30 bpm within the first 10 minutes of standing or head-up tilt (HUT) in the absence of orthostatic hypotension. The complex heterogeneous etiologies of POTS generally classify as neuropathic, hyperadrenergic, hypovolemic, autoimmune, and physical deconditioning with significant overlap between the various etiologies.

To derive good outcomes, a complete picture of the heart must be reviewed beforehand by the surgeon regardless of the type of operation. Coronary anatomy must be reviewed even in valve operations. Cardiologists must perform an echo even in coronary artery bypass grafting surgeries. Evidence-based guidelines regarding the best\u00a0myocardial protection strategy\u00a0are not available because of the heterogeneity in patients' characteristics. Nevertheless, several questionnaires revealed that most surgeons favor blood cardioplegia over other USA\u00a0and UK techniques. [9] [8]"}

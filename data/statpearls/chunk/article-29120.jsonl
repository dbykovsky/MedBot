CT is the principal modality in imaging of the traumatic skull lesions since it not only provides perfect visualization of cortical bone but also offers a very short imaging time allowing immediate intervention before brain damage or death. Besides, it is regarded as the most accurate method in the detection of a cerebrospinal fluid leak. Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) allows rapid volumetric image data acquisition, and with the use of sub-millimetric slice thickness, it permits multiplanar reformations (MPR) and 3-dimensional (3D) reconstructions. [8] [11] [12] 2D axial and coronal images are more sensitive and reliable than 3D reconstructions in the detection and detailed evaluation of skull fractures. However, since 3D imaging provides a global view of the fracture pattern and has significant contributions in preoperative planning, it is widely requested by surgeons. For this reason, 3D reconstructions should be added to the imaging study in skull fracture cases, especially in those detected in the maxillofacial area. [8] CT and MRI are complementary modalities for imaging focal skull lesions, and both are performed in most cases, especially in skull base lesions.

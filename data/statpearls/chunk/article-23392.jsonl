Evaluation of changes in COVID-19 patients at primary infection, six-month, and one-year follow-up, indicated that these total serum Ig concentrations remained steady over time. In summary, patients with either low IgM or low IgG3 had an increased risk of acquiring PACS, whereas patients with both high IgM and high IgG3 were less likely to develop PACS.

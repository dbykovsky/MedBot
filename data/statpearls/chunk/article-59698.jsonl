Cine images are valuable for evaluating large masses, demonstrating the origin of the mass, and demonstrating spatial relationships to adjacent structures. A dynamic evaluation provides additional characterization. [17] Compression of the abnormality is useful to evaluate for swirling of contents within a complex cystic lesion, as may be seen in a ganglion cyst. The movement of adjacent structures can aid in determining the origin of the lesion, as in the case of a giant cell tumor of the tendon sheath, as this lesion would not move while moving the tendon itself during flexion or extension of the joint."}

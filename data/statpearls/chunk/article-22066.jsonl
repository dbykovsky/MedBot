The commonality among these conditions is the impairment of normal processes that allow proper uptake, conjugation, and excretion of bilirubin waste products. Other accessory organ pathologies include hemochromatosis, Wilson disease, biliary tract diseases, and pancreatitis. Diseases of the gallbladder prevent proper storage of bile from the liver, leading to malabsorption in the gut. Examples of these conditions include cholelithiasis, choledocholithiasis, and cholecystitis.", "contents": "Physiology, Gastrointestinal -- Clinical Significance.

All four quadrants of the abdomen must be inspected to appreciate the general abdominal contour. [22] Proper inspection allows for identifying any surgical scars, bulges, hemangiomas, or dilated veins of a caput medusae when present. Patients may be asked to cough to check for abdominal herniation. After inspection, auscultation is performed to detect any abnormal bowel sounds, rubs, or bruits. It is necessary to consider the anatomical location of the different abdominal organs, as this determines the sounds heard and the pathologies that correlate. For example, auscultating the right upper quadrant checks for liver rubs and bowel sounds while listening to the left upper quadrant examines rubs or bruits within the splenic region. The sounds' pitch, intensity, and duration should also be appreciated during auscultation.", "contents": "Physiology, Gastrointestinal -- Clinical Significance.

The left upper quadrant, periumbilical, left, and right lower quadrants are subsequently palpated to identify any unusual masses or signs of discomfort. The liver and spleen are solid organs that, when percussed, elicit a dull sound. Percussing the abdomen in the areas overlying these organs serves the purpose of assessing the size of the liver and spleen and determining whether tenderness is present.

[4] Amiodarone should be avoided for 3-6 months prior to an I-123 RAIU or uptake and scan. [2] Additional medications to hold include anti-thyroid medications, including methimazole, carbimazole, propylthiouracil and thyroid hormone replacement, including levothyroxine (LT4) and liothyronine (LT3)."}

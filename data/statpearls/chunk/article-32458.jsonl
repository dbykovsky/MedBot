This migration process initiates with the release of neutrophil chemokines, such as interleukin-8 and granulocyte chemotactic protein. Funisitis is most commonly present in the setting of intraamniotic infection, specifically chorioamnionitis, and is part of the fetal inflammatory response syndrome, which indicates a high risk of preterm labor and increased neonatal morbidity.\u00a0This process is identified microscopically after delivery, but due to the need for mature neutrophils within fetal blood, it is not typically present before 20 weeks of gestation.

If the cord becomes wound around the fetal neck, it is referred to as a nuchal cord. The incidence of the nuchal cord is estimated at up to 29% at term, with the incidence increasing relative to gestational age. When the fetus descends during labor, increased torsional forces on the umbilical cord can decrease blood flow through the umbilical vessels and lead to signs of fetal distress and acidosis. When discovered, expedient reduction of the nuchal cord is important to return proper blood flow to the fetus and avoid prolonged asphyxia.

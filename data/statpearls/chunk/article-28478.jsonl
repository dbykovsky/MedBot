This usually occurs after a traumatic injury and may require surgery to fix. Sometimes the bleeding occurs because of cancer, the use of blood thinners, abnormal enlargement of blood vessels, or other diseases of the belly. As is the case with all procedures, unintentional bleeding can occur. Surgeries on the abdomen or surgeries that examine the arteries of the heart can cause bleeding into this retroperitoneal space and may require hospital admission and potentially further procedures to correct the problem.", "contents": "Retroperitoneal Bleeding -- Deterrence and Patient Education.

The breast tissue lies on the pectoralis major muscle and is supported by many ligaments that arise from either side of the sternum. Each breast consists of 20 lobes that are dispersed\u00a0evenly\u00a0below the nipple. Surrounding each lobe is fatty tissue that gives the breast its shape and size. Each of the lobes consists of numerous lobules which produce milk in response to prolactin and the female sex hormones. The female breast can develop cystic and solid lesions in the lobes. In general, the majority of cystic lesions are benign, and the majority of solid lesions\u00a0are malignant. Breast cysts tend to develop at the terminal end of the ducts and accumulate fluid. [5] Most breast cysts are small ranging in diameter from 5 mm to 20 mm and may fluctuate in size over the course of the menstrual cycle. A female may develop one or multiple cysts. Most of these cysts are painless, but some women may have discomfort or discover them during palpation of the breast.", "contents": "Fine Needle Aspiration of Breast Masses -- Anatomy and Physiology.

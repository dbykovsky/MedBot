There are several brachytherapy options that have emerged in the last two decades to allow for additional radiation to be given for surgically operable recurrent gliomas. The GliaSite \u00ae system is an inflatable catheter that can be inserted into a resection cavity and inflated with a solution of I-125 or Cs-131, allowed to dwell in the cavity over several days. [28] The total dose is typically 60 Gy prescribed to 1cm from the surgical cavity. [28] The median survival was 35.9 months, with a 1-year survival of 31.1%. [28] The procedure is well tolerated, but a survival benefit has not been demonstrated. [29] [30] Potential candidates include those with tumors less than 4 cm in size that are roughly spherical."}

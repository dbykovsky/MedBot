These plants produce toxic compounds called belladonna alkaloids as a protective mechanism. [7] Scopolamine competitively inhibits G-protein coupled post-ganglionic muscarinic receptors for acetylcholine and acts as a nonselective muscarinic antagonist, producing both peripheral antimuscarinic properties and central sedative, antiemetic, and amnestic effects. [8] It is structurally very similar to atropine and is useful in conditions requiring decreased parasympathetic activity. Peripherally this results in smooth muscle relaxation and reduced gland secretion. Centrally, unlike atropine, scopolamine causes mostly sedation, but over-excitement and restlessness can occur at higher doses. [7]", "contents": "Scopolamine -- Mechanism of Action.

Per package labeling, the recommendation is to apply scopolamine the night before surgery if used to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting or four hours before exposure if used for motion sickness. For cesarean sections, apply one hour before surgery to limit exposure to the baby. The manufacturer also recommends discontinuation of the patch 24 hours after surgery because there was no significant antiemetic effect of scopolamine for PONV between 24 and 48 hours.

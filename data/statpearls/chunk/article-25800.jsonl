[7]", "contents": "Neuroleptic Medications -- Monitoring. For first-generation (typical) antipsychotic drugs, therapeutic drug monitoring is often recommended for compliance control and to minimize extrapyramidal reactions by maintaining chronic exposure at appropriate blood levels. In the case of clozapine, therapeutic drug monitoring is essential due to safety concerns regarding agranulocytosis, myocarditis, and seizures. Physicians should obtain a complete blood count (CBC) and absolute neutrophil count before and after initiating clozapine treatment. Olanzapine carries a risk of postinjection delirium/sedation syndrome, [28] necessitating administration in a registered healthcare facility with immediate access to emergency response services. Patients receiving olanzapine injections should be observed for at least 3 hours after administering the injection and accompanied upon discharge. [7]"}

Regarding plasma levels related to therapeutic effects, established ideal concentrations for clozapine are (350 to\u00a0600 ng/mL), risperidone (20 to\u00a060 ng/mL), and olanzapine (20 to 80 ng/mL), but not for the other second-generation antipsychotics.

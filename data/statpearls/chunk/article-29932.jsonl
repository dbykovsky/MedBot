[25] The definition of refractory epilepsy has no objective definition but gets determined through the assessment of various domains that influence the prognosis of the condition such a frequency and severity of seizures, the number of AED failures and adverse effects of AEDs used, and the subsequent impact on the livelihood of the individual with epilepsy. [26] Seizure remission, or tractable seizures, may be considered as a period of greater than 6 months to 2 years of seizure freedom. [26]  Surgery is one option for individuals with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy and may provide up to an 80 percent remission rate in individuals with\u00a0HS. [5] Evidence suggests the superiority of the addition of temporal lobe surgery over AEDs alone, for seizure control in refractory cases. [27] [28] Early surgical evaluation and intervention, when indicated, may be beneficial through improvements in quality of life indices as\u00a0well as evidence suggesting an improvement in intelligence quotient (IQ) scores, and overall lifetime medical cost with pediatric surgical interventions.

This incision is slanted to avoid the primary auditory cortex in the first temporal gyrus. In comparison, the anteromedial temporal resection technique was developed to preserve more function of the lateral temporal lobe, in addition to aid in the access of mesial temporal structures. This procedure removes around 5 to 6 cm of the temporal lobe. The cortical incision is initiated at about 3 to 3.5 cm from the temporal tip and continued inferiorly towards the third temporal gyrus, with sparing of the auditory cortex in the first temporal gyrus.

[30] The choice of open surgery versus selective interventions should be under the guidance by the challenges provided by the lesion, either locational or intrinsic characteristics. Included in more selective and less invasive approaches to anatomical correction for temporal lobe epilepsy are stereotactic radiosurgery as well as stereotactic laser ablation. These interventions are also valuable in lesional sites that are difficult or too risky to access via open surgical procedures. Recent evidence suggests that stereotactic radiosurgery provided similar results as open surgery with regards to seizure remission rates and neuropsychological prognosis, but has an extensive latency period until maximum therapeutic benefits, needed for corrective radio-surgical lesion formation. It also appears to have limited benefits in individuals with lesions secondary to arteriovenous malformations, as it may be associated with rebleeding.

[1] Etiologies and risk factors for HF are diverse and encompass processes such as myocardial injury or infarction, CAD, chronic hypertension, valvular dysfunction, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies, and numerous other pathways. The pathophysiology resulting in HF involves complex interactions of systems such as neurohormonal activation, peripheral vascular effects, and physiological processes within the heart muscle itself. [1] Treatment for HF involves pharmacotherapy such as ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers to decrease heart stress and workload or inotropes to increase contractility. Therapies for advanced heart failure include mechanical circulatory support such as ventricular assist devices (VADs) or heart transplantation."}

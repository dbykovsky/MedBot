MET is largely considered a direct, active treatment, as patients are often positioned toward a barrier, prompting them to move to generate an activating force. There are 9 physiological principles in muscle energy, including post-isometric relaxation, respiratory assist, joint mobilization using muscle force, oculocephalic reflex, reciprocal inhibition, crossed extensor reflex, isokinetic strengthening, isolytic lengthening, and muscle force in one region of the body to achieve movement in another. Among the 9 types of METs, post-isometric isolation stands out as the most commonly used technique. In this approach, the patient is positioned toward a barrier and applies an activating force toward freedom. The isometric contraction induced by this method leads to reciprocal inhibition and relaxation of the antagonistic muscle, effectively addressing soft tissue restrictive barriers and mobilizing joints. This process contributes to pain reduction and improved circulation.

Surgical decompression: To approach the superficial branch of the radial nerve,\u00a0palpate the radial styloid process and follow the border of the brachioradialis proximal 10 cm. Draw a line connecting the two. Identify the area with the most pronounced Tinel response, tenderness, and allodynia. Then center\u00a0your incision over this. Carefully elevate skin flaps to identify the brachioradialis and extensor carpi radialis longus tendons. The superficial branch of the radial nerve generally appears between the two tendons with brachioradialis located above and extensor carpi radialis longus located below. [12] Carefully dissect out the nerve and free it from adhesions. Remove any masses, adhesions, or fascial bands that could be compressing the nerve. Once fully decompressed, one can choose to wrap the nerve in a number of different adhesive barriers, including but not limited to amniotic membranes or fascial flaps. The area of nerve compression is carefully measured, and the adhesion barrier is trimmed to match. It is then placed around the nerve and secured loosely in place with 8-0 nylon sutures if needed. Attention is necessary for circumferential coverage without strangulation of the nerve. Upon achieving vascularity is confirmed, and hemostasis, one can proceed with layered closure and application of a soft sterile dressing. [12]"}

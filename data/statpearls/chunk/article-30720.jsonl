The organism is ingested in contaminated food or water and survives the stomach acid. It penetrates the small bowel epithelium and enters the lymphoid tissue.

The fever increases as the bacteremia increases; however, the heart rate may be lower than expected for the corresponding fever. The second week of the disease is characterized by abdominal pain, constipation, and a faint macular rash on the trunk and abdomen. During the third week of illness, when there has been no treatment, enlargement of the liver and spleen may develop, along with ileocecal perforation, peritonitis, and septic shock in up to 30% of people.

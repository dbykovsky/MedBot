This is implemented by incorporating DNA I polymerase, which is derived from Thermus aquaticus, also known as Taq polymerase. Taq polymerase consists of thermostable properties preventing the irreversible alteration of the DNA or RNA physical and chemical properties, making it ideal for the highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction procedure for diagnosing a wide range of bacterial and viral infections, as well as screening genetic diseases.", "contents": "Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

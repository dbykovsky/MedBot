For instance, a 3-month-old infant's fluid requirements significantly differ from those of a fully grown child aged 8 or older. In many cases, a simple calculation called the 4-2-1 rule can determine the hourly rate of fluid maintenance required for a child based on their body weight. [13] The formula outlined below illustrates its application, where fluid maintenance rates are calculated based on the following criteria: First 10 kg: 4 mL/kg/h Next 10 to 20 kg: 2 mL/kg/h Any remaining weight more than 20 kg: 1 mL/kg/h For example, a child whose body weight is 22 kg would have the following requirements for maintenance fluid: First 10 kg: 4 mL/kg/h x 10 kg = 40 mL/h Next 10 to 20 kg: 2 mL/kg/h x 10 kg = 20 mL/h Remaining 2 kg: 1 mL/kg/h x 2 kg = 2 mL/h Total hourly rate: 40 + 20 + 2 = 62 mL/h"}

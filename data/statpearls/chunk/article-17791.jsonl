This can occur in patients concurrently using prescription and non-prescription medications, as well as herbal and nutritional supplements, and is considered a class effect. [13] Due to CYP3A4 inhibition, patients using pimozide should avoid NK-1 receptor antagonists. Inhibiting the CYP3A4 enzyme may increase plasma concentrations of pimozide\u2014a CYP3A4 substrate. The drug interaction between pimozide and aprepitant could result in severe or life-threatening reactions, including QTc prolongation, a known adverse reaction of pimozide. [14]"}

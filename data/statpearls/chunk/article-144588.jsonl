These epigenetic modifications, which may be the consequence of an increase in maternal nutrition supply to the developing fetus, promote increased hunger and fat accumulation in children. Children with obesity are five times more likely to be obese in adulthood. [33] This lends credibility to starting obesity-related prevention strategies earlier to reduce obesity prevalence in adulthood. Another area for improvement is by adding healthier school lunch options. A study using non-linear regression models found that children who attended public schools had a higher BMI regardless of socioeconomic status.

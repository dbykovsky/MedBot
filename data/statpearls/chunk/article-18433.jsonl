Bombesin can help to distinguish late-onset hypogammaglobulinemia from X-linked agammaglobulinemia, early-onset hypogammaglobulinemia, and lymphoproliferative cancer. [50] This differentiation would also help to identify patients with an increased risk for gastric cancer. Plasma gastrin responses to stimulation with bombesin correlate with late-onset hypogammaglobulinemia.", "contents": "Biochemistry, Bombesin -- Clinical Significance. Measuring bombesin stimulated gastrin response can serve as a marker for patients who are at very high risk for gastric cancer. Patients with late-onset hypogammaglobulinemia are at very high risk for gastric cancer. Late-onset hypogammaglobulinemia patients have reduced secretion of gastrin after stimulation with bombesin. Stimulated gastrin response can, therefore, be useful as a marker for this type of immunodeficiency. Plasma gastrin responses to stimulation with bombesin correlate with late-onset hypogammaglobulinemia. (72% sensitivity , 100% specificity). Bombesin can help to distinguish late-onset hypogammaglobulinemia from X-linked agammaglobulinemia, early-onset hypogammaglobulinemia, and lymphoproliferative cancer.

The rupture of membranes does eliminate the primary barrier between the fetus and the polymicrobial environment of the vagina. If performed too early in the labor process, there can be an increased risk of intrapartum chorioamnionitis.

In the case of an unengaged fetal head, the rupture of membranes may allow for the umbilical cord to precede the fetal head when the release of amniotic fluid occurs. This will allow the fetal head to compress the section of the umbilical cord preceding the head, generally leading to fetal bradycardia and necessitating emergency cesarean section.

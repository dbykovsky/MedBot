AAD carries a high mortality, which differs depending on the location of the dissection. Those affecting the ascending aorta treated medically carry overall mortality of 24% in 24 hours, 44% in 7 days, and up to 49% in 14 days. Surgically managed type A dissection has lower mortality of 10% in the first 24 hours, 16% in 7 days, and up to 20% in 14 days.

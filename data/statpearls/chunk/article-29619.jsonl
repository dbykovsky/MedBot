Care from different members of the health care team including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and other health care professionals provide different perspectives and skillsets in patient evaluation, management, and treatment of subcutaneous emphysema when all caregivers work collaboratively. In the post-anesthesia care or critical care unit, nurses\u00a0can outline gaseous spread with a pen, watch vital signs, and monitor the patient more frequently than a physician. Grading the degree of\u00a0subcutaneous emphysema can be easily done at the bedside. [7] Physician specialist involvement is also imperative to ensure comprehensive care of the patient including recognizing the patients with high risk to develop subcutaneous emphysema. The radiologist can detect the presence of subcutaneous emphysema that may not be detectable on an exam and\u00a0identify a likely source of gaseous spread. The thoracic, general, or other surgical specialists\u00a0can monitor progression intraoperatively as well as provide surgical fixation for the source of\u00a0subcutaneous emphysema if necessary. Anesthesiologists perform pre-operative risk assessment using ASA grading system,\u00a0secure compromised airways, manage ventilator settings, as well as perform bronchoscopies and transesophageal echocardiograms for diagnostic evaluation.

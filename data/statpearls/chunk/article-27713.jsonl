Surgical intervention in priapism aims to relieve pain and shorten the duration of corporal ischemia, which would otherwise lead to continuing pain, fibrosis, and permanent erectile dysfunction. When a patient with prolonged priapism of 48 hours or longer presents for treatment, it may be prudent to explain that even with optimal care at that point, much damage has likely occurred to the erectile tissue and corpora already, which may not be reversible. In such cases of resistant ischemic priapism and those of 48 hours duration or longer, serious consideration should be given to full corporal dilation with immediate penile prosthesis implantation. [72] If a penile prosthesis cannot be placed emergently, it should be implanted at the earliest opportunity, usually within a few weeks after full corporal dilation if possible, as the dilated corpora cavernosa will become densely fibrotic given time, making delayed penile prosthesis implantation much more difficult, and less satisfactory.

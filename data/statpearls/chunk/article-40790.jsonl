Mosquitoes are generally found near standing bodies of water as this environment is necessary for the completion of their life cycle. Only the larger female mosquitoes actually bite, as they need blood nourishment for egg production.\u00a0Each genus of mosquito has its distinctive patterns of feeding. Daytime feeders are attracted by dark-colored clothing, but as they near their host, they use olfactory cues, carbon dioxide, and lactic acid, to hone in. The consensus is that certain sweat glands, fragrances,\u00a0and even alcohol make people more attractive to mosquitoes.

After more bites from the same species, they develop an immediate reaction, peaking at 30 minutes, in addition to this delayed response.

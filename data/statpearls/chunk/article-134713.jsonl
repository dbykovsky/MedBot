Possessing a foundation in education of the most intricate details of oxygen delivery should be a mandatory aspect of care. ECMO entails many ethical dilemmas as it heavily involves children\u2019s families in the decision-making process. When ECMO is being considered acutely, there is often limited time to assess the estimated course of the patient\u2019s clinical condition, reversibility of the underlying disease process, actual candidacy for heart or lung transplant, and the balance between post-survival quality of life with the family\u2019s goals of care.

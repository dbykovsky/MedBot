Always send fluid for biochemistry, culture, and cytology. Use Light's criteria to distinguish exudate from transudate. Lymphocyte-predominant effusions are usually due to malignancy and tuberculosis. Check pH when aspirating pleural effusions. Do not inject air or local anesthetic into the sample, which may alter the fluid's pH. Malignant effusions can be detected on cytology (40% to 60%)."}

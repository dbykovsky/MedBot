It is imperative to follow an interprofessional approach when treating patients with androgen insensitivity syndrome. It requires management by an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals, including an endocrinologist (pediatric or adult), urologist, gynecologist, primary care provider, clinical psychologist, neonatologist, clinical genetics, medical ethics, physician assistants, specialty-trained nurses, and social services. This interprofessional approach assists in appropriate and sensitive management of the condition and prepares the child and the family to overcome the challenges with additional support from patient advocacy groups. Pasterskietal et al. conducted a study to assess the clinical management of disorders of sex development (DSD) with the help of an online questionnaire and audit of DSD literature sent to pediatric endocrinologists from 60 medical centers representing 23 European countries. They studied the interprofessional team composition, psychological support services, and also the incidence of feminizing clitoroplasty. The study noted that 57% of centers regularly included the interprofessional approach utilizing the services of recommended pediatric subspecialists: pediatric endocrinologist, pediatric surgeon/urologist, plastic surgeon, pediatric psychiatrist/psychologist, gynecologist, clinical geneticist, histopathologist, and neonatologist.

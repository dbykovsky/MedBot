Cranial nerve examination is crucial. For example, abnormalities in the trigemino-facial pathways can be detected by testing the blink and masseter reflexes.

Other causes of taste disorders affect either the peripheral or central nervous system. Peripheral lesions comprise syndromes of the glossopharyngeal or facial nerve, the most common being idiopathic Bell palsy. Other lesions of the facial nerve include infectious neuritis or space-occupying masses of the cerebellopontine angle. A frequent cause of glossopharyngeal dysfunction is the dissection of the cervical arteries. [34] CNS disorders can be organized into pathologies of the brainstem, thalamus, or cortex. Brainstem lesions present with ipsilateral hemiageusia/hemihypogeusia and are often a consequence of cerebrovascular insults or demyelination. Thalamic lesions, however, cause a contralateral presentation. Culprits for cortical gustatory dysfunction include epilepsy, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and stroke.", "contents": "Gustatory Testing -- Clinical Significance.

At\u00a0the same time, this creates a negative pressure under the slab. Passive subslab suction is similar to active subslab suction. However, it\u00a0is not as effective at reducing radon levels. It relies primarily on natural pressure differentials instead of a fan. Certain types of houses have drain tiles  or perforated pipes near the base of the house. Adding suction can help reduce radon levels. Another variation is a sump hole suction.\u00a0When a sump that usually drains water from a house is capped, it can be used as a location for a radon suction pipe that removes radon with the expelled water. Finally, block wall suction can be utilized in basements with hollow block suction walls. This reduces radon, depressurizes the wall, and is usually used with a sub-slab suction."}

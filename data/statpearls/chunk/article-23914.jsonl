This design did not produce favorable results and was eventually replaced with metal implants in the 1930s. In the 1950s, a hinged prosthesis was designed to replace the femur and tibia, as well as the stabilizing ligaments surrounding the knee. While this produced satisfactory results, there was a high rate of failure and poor long-term outcome due to the failure of reproducing the natural kinematics of the knee joint.\u00a0 This was subsequently replaced with a prosthesis that replicated the shape of the distal femur, preserved the collateral and cruciate ligaments, and consisted of a plastic bearing on the tibia. Since this breakthrough in prosthesis in the 1970s, the design has evolved to focus on replicating the anatomy and normal function of the knee joint. Furthermore, advances have been made in fixation techniques and wear properties of the bearing surface which positively affects the longevity of the knee replacement.

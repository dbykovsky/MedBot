Hepatic impairment : Generally, cephalosporins are known for their low propensity for hepatotoxicity, and instances of drug-induced liver injury attributed to these agents are infrequent in the published literature. Notably, an exception exists with ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin. When administered parenterally, ceftriaxone has been associated with the formation of biliary sludge, with symptoms resembling those of cholecystitis and cholestatic jaundice. [26] Pharmacokinetic investigations conducted in cirrhosis have\u00a0demonstrated heterogeneous results concerning the half-life of cefotaxime. However, cefotaxime has a broad therapeutic index, suggesting that dosage adjustments may not be\u00a0necessary\u00a0for hepatic impairment. In the context of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis therapy, cefotaxime's comprehensive coverage and high ascitic fluid concentrations make it a preferred antibiotic. Empirical antibiotic therapy, cefotaxime, administered every\u00a08 hours, has demonstrated excellent ascitic fluid concentrations and clinical efficacy. [27]"}

The course of the congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type is progressive, leads to end-stage renal disease by 2-3 years of age. Prognosis is worse in NPHS1 gene mutations compared with NPHS2 gene mutations. Prognosis is different in patients with different ethnic backgrounds. Female patients with NPHS1 mutations have longer survival than their male counterparts.

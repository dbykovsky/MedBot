For clinical thinking, the left side of the heart also involves the systemic blood supply, as does the right side of the heart with the pulmonary vasculature. With diseases affecting these circuits, we can now follow the blood flow from one compartment to the next and understand how, for instance, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can create pulmonary hypertension, thus causing an increased workload on the right side of the heart and subsequent pathology."}

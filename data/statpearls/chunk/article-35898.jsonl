[5] It presents as symmetrically distributed pigmented macules and patches. [6] Factors that play a role in the pathogenesis of melasma are darker skin, UV radiation, hormones, genetics, and antiepileptic medications. Exposure to UV radiation is the main factor in pathogenesis as UV radiation increases alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone and adrenocorticotropic hormone levels, which increases the proliferation of melanocytes. [7] Also, at the dermal layer, increased expression of stem cells of fibroblasts and tyrosine kinase receptor c-kit is present in melasma lesions. Also noted in lesions are upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Wnt, and reactive oxygen species seen after UV-induced dermal inflammation. Vascularization and melanocyte hyperreactivity results from this UV-induced inflammation leading to increased melanin production and hyperpigmentation. Patients who are pregnant or use oral contraceptives are also at risk because the expression of estrogen receptors seems to rise in melasma lesions as well. [8] [6] Estrogen also induces the release of melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), which stimulates tyrosinase leading to increased melanin production. For this reason, melasma occurs more frequently in females vs. males.

A gastroenterologist consultation is usually needed to confirm the diagnosis with endoscopy. Similarly, a pharmacist can be a good source for both physician and patient to know\u00a0regarding drug absorption or therapeutic properties of medicines if any liquid preparation is available for the particular medication in a patient who has difficulty swallowing. A nutritionist and pharmacist can also help with parenteral nutrition formulation to meet nutrition requirements in a patient with severe symptoms requiring nothing by mouth status."}

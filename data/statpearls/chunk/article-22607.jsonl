Prevention methods include seatbelt use, child safety seats or boosters, strict avoidance of motor vehicle operation under the influence of drugs or alcohol, helmet use when using open, unrestrained vehicles, helmet use during sports, fall prevention methods in the elderly and others at risk, and securing windows to prevent children from falling. For patients with mild TBI, simple educational materials regarding return to activity and work/school have been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms.

This dimerization leads to JAK2 tyrosine kinase phosphorylating three tyrosine residues that serve as docking sites for the proteins SHP2, STAT5, and STAT3.

{"id": "article-24193_4", "title": "Physiology, Leptin -- Function", "content": "Taken as a whole, leptin\u2019s function in the body pertains to regulating the balance between food intake and energy expenditure. The classic primary physiologic role of leptin is to serve as a marker of long-term energy stores for the central nervous system (CNS). [8] As the amount of adipose tissue decreases, the amount of leptin produced and crossing the blood-brain barrier decreases. The CNS interrupts the decline in leptin as a signal of energy deficit, which triggers a cascade of responses to help the body deal with the stress of starvation. To counteract the energy deficit, the CNS increases hunger while also promoting energy-sparing neuroendocrine and autonomic mechanisms, including decreased sympathetic nervous system tone, thyroid, and reproductive hormone levels, energy expenditure, and growth. As this signal, leptin is the catalyst for the body's transition into a starvation mode, a global adaption aimed towards increasing food intake and decreasing energy expenditure. A decrease in serum leptin then is the starvation signal for the CNS. As food intake increases and the level of adipose tissue becomes excessive, there is a concurrent rise in the production and secretion of leptin into the bloodstream.

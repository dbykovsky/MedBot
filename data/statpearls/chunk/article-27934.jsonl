Pseudogenes from humans, chimpanzees, dogs, cows, mice, and rats were found to have conserved point mutations at various gene locations.

Mutations that are not deleterious to pseudogenes allow them to persist and undergo evolution with acquired random mutations and genetic drifts. These established pseudogenes can, therefore, be powerful tools for phylogenetic studies investigating the evolution of specific genes. [4]", "contents": "Biochemistry, Pseudogenes -- Fundamentals.

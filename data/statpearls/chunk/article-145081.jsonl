Common causes of iatrogenic aniseikonia include: Monovision refractive or cataract surgery: In these cases, one eye is corrected for near use, the other for distance. If the patient can not adapt, spectacle correction may result in aniseikonia and is not tolerated. Second-eye cataract surgery. The second eye is delayed to have cataract surgery in about 30% of patients with cataract surgery of the first eye. Careful planning on the refractive outcome is essential to avoid aniseikonia while the patient is waiting for the second-eye cataract to mature. Scleral buckle and insertion of silicone oil procedures for retinal detachment: These procedures\u00a0may generate enough anisometropia to produce symptoms of aniseikonia. There is evidence that retinal detachment surgery can often be done without using a scleral buckle. [58] [59]"}

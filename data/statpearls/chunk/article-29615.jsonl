However, in a different study including a high-risk patient population such as elderly patients over 75, hospitalized patients, those with malignancy, or those with upper extremity catheters/devices, the algorithm did not perform as well in differentiating a subset of patients where imaging could be withheld. Therefore, this strategy may be more advantageous for patients with low risk for venous thromboembolism."}

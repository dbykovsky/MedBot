Glucagon may be administered as a bolus of 5 to 10 mg IV, with close monitoring for nausea and vomiting; patients may receive antiemetics as a pre-medication to mitigate these adverse effects. In cases where patients are refractory to these interventions, healthcare providers should consider initiating vasopressor therapy using IV norepinephrine or push-dose phenylephrine while simultaneously preparing hyperinsulinemia/euglycemia (HIE) therapy. HIE increases cardiac contractility through enhanced glucose transport into myocardial cells, thereby correcting hypo-insulinemia. A bolus of insulin of 1 unit/kg\u00a0should be administered, followed by an infusion of 1 to 10 units/kg/h. [19] [20] The patient's glucose levels should be monitored for hypoglycemia initially every 10 minutes and then every 30 to 60 minutes to maintain glucose levels between 100\u00a0and 200 mg/dL. To sustain these levels, healthcare providers should utilize a concurrent dextrose infusion as needed.", "contents": "Calcium Channel Blockers -- Toxicity -- Managing CCB-Induced Hypotension.

IV lipid emulsion therapy lacks clear evidence for efficacy but may be considered if all other interventions fail. A bolus of IV lipid emulsion 20% at a dose of 1.5 mL/kg should be administered, repeated if necessary, followed by an infusion of 0.25 to 0.5 mL/kg/min for 1 hour. Reports suggest that methylene blue, particularly in amlodipine overdose patients, may be effective in managing vasodilatory shock. [21] Phosphodiesterase inhibitors represent another option in CCB therapy; they increase cardiac output by inhibiting the breakdown of cAMP. In cases refractory to the aforementioned interventions, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has succeeded as it sustains perfusion to vital organs and continues hepatic metabolism.", "contents": "Calcium Channel Blockers -- Toxicity -- Managing CCB-Induced Hypotension.

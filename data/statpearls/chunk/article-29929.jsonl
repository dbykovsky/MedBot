The development of the temporal lobe, part of the forebrain, is linked closely to the development of the cerebral cortex. The embryonic ectoderm contains a specialized part known as the neural plate. The neural plate folds to create the neural tube. The neural tube houses the four ventricles,\u00a0which are\u00a0closed\u00a0spaces containing cerebrospinal fluid,\u00a0within the brain.\u00a0The most anterior portion of the neural plate, the prosencephalon, eventually forms the cerebral cortex. At about three and a half weeks' gestation, the three portions of the brain become apparent from the neural plate. These portions include the\u00a0prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon.\u00a0At about six weeks, a bend in the neural plate is visible.\u00a0At seven weeks, the hemispheres of the brain start to become apparent. At fourteen weeks, the hemispheres are clearly visible, and at five months they\u00a0have grown to occupy most of the brain. At eight months, the characteristic gyri and sulci, the ridges and valleys, of the cerebral cortex become clear."}

One route involves blood passing from the temporal lobe anteriorly to superficial middle cerebral vein.

The other route involves blood flowing from the interior temporal lobe into the posterior choroidal vein.

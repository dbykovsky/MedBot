Comorbid major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder are prevalent comorbidities associated with chronic pain. The treatment of underlying anxiety and depression can have a lasting impact on the efficacy of a spinal cord stimulator and the treatment of the primary pain disorder. A primary care provider, cognitive-behavioral therapist, and psychiatrist are often needed to address the patient's mental healthcare. Both pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment options are often necessary.", "contents": "Spinal Cord Stimulator Implant -- Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions.

The first step to creating an accurate patient evaluation is ensuring that healthcare professionals understand the difference between \"impairment\" and \"disability.\" An impairment can be understood as any deviation or loss of body function or structure. [1] [2] Disability is characterized by limitations or reductions in the individual\u2019s ability to participate in their activities of daily living (ADL) due to a disease or health condition. [1] [3] It is important to understand there is no definite relationship between disability and impairment. An individual may have significant impairment, such as an amputated arm, but would not be considered significantly disabled because they are still able to engage in their daily tasks successfully. Alternatively, an individual may have a minor impairment that causes significant limitations for that person\u2019s daily activities. For example, an individual with arthritis in their knee cannot tolerate a full day of work, causing them to lose employment. Because impairment and disability vary for each case, health care providers are encouraged to consider disability in terms of a spectrum of ability to function\u00a0and rate a patient\u2019s impairment depending on how the impairment impacts the patient\u2019s ADL participation.

This means that without the evaluation and assessment of a healthcare provider, individuals may not qualify for disability aid. [3] [7] Therefore, healthcare professionals must understand how different patients might be eligible for disability aid. Part of the difficulty with disability determination is that multiple services provide disability aid, and each service works differently. For example, the Social Security Administration (SSA) determines disability aid based on its definitions of impairment and disability. For the SSA to recognize an impairment, the impairment must be medically determined through accepted diagnostic methods. This means using valid and reliable methods or assessments through a licensed provider. [7] For a disability, the SSA requires that a patient\u2019s activity engagement limit must be expected to continue, or must have already continued, for a full year. [3] Other disability providers, such as workers\u2019 compensation, state disability programs, and private disability insurance policies, all have different qualification requirements and award disability benefits differently.", "contents": "Disability Determination And Impairment Rating -- Issues of Concern.

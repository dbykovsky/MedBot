Calcitriol serves as a transcription factor to encode a calcium-binding protein, which simultaneously transports calcium and phosphate ions across intestinal epithelial cells. [3] Along with parathyroid hormone, calcitriol stimulates bone resorption by activating osteoclasts through the release of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) from osteoblasts. Topically, studies have found that calcitriol significantly inhibits the proliferation of normal human epidermal keratinocytes and T lymphocytes by inducing apoptosis, as well as inhibiting gene expression of relevant chemokines and epidermal proteins involved in psoriasis.

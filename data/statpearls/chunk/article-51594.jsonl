Multidisciplinary consultation: PERT convenes to discuss the case and treatment options. Consider the potential roles of each specialty: Critical care:\u00a0Hemodynamic management,\u00a0respiratory support Pulmonology:\u00a0Diagnosis,\u00a0risk stratification,\u00a0follow-up Cardiology:\u00a0Medical management,\u00a0thrombolysis consideration Radiology:\u00a0Advanced imaging,\u00a0procedures (eg,\u00a0catheter embolectomy) Vascular surgery:\u00a0Surgical thrombectomy if needed Hematology:\u00a0Anticoagulation selection,\u00a0thrombophilia evaluation Pharmacy:\u00a0Medication dosing and monitoring 5. Treatment decision: PERT collaboratively determines the most appropriate treatment approach based on patient factors and available resources. Options may include:"}

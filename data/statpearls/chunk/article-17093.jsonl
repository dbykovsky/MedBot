To keep a physiological neutral state, chloride ions migrate out of the cells and into the extracellular space. This causes the patient\u2019s serum chloride to increase and keeps the anion gap at a normal level. This means a metabolic acidosis without an abnormal anion gap is also a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. A metabolic acidosis without an increased anion gap results from many processes, including severe diarrhea, type I renal tubular acidosis (RTA), long-term use of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and suctioning of gastric contents. When a patient has a narrow ion gap hyperchloremic acidosis, the provider can calculate the urine anion gap (UAG) to help determine the etiology.

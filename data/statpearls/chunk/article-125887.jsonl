Despite evidence-based arguments supporting paternalistic framing as a preferred first-line approach to informing patients about risks due to patients' statistical illiteracy, counterfactual research indicates that many patients choose preferentially to make medical decisions based on their data assessment based on their doctors' opinions. [31] But policies do not yet exist requiring HCPs to (1) employ published models to derive and inform patients about their estimated risks from imaging exams or (2) discuss the potential cost, lack of added value, and diagnostic inaccuracy rates of medical imaging exams being considered on their behalf. Studies show marked heterogeneity in whether and how best patients could comprehend medical probability data. [32] [33] Debates will continue about whether discussing these issues with patients results in more harm than good, which data should be shared, how the data should be shared, and which healthcare team members should hold the discussion. The solution involves employing a patient-dependent, shared-decision approach."}

If an HCP can locate only a relative risk estimate of an adverse outcome (such as developing fatal cancer), they can calculate an estimate of absolute risk by multiplying the relative risk by the disease prevalence. The HCP faced with this task can choose to locate the prevalence from another study designed to determine prevalence (one that can be assessed as relevant to the HCP's environment). Alternatively, the HCP can estimate absolute risk using the event rate in the control group of whatever randomized trial or cohort study is available and is most similar to the real-life environment at the time. We return to the previous example of the generic\u00a0White race man who, as a result of a 100 mSv exposure at age 40, experiences an ERR of 4%. Based on data obtained from the population in which he lives, his background risk (prevalence) of developing a fatal solid organ cancer of 22.8% by age 75. His EAR of developing fatal cancer by age 75 due to a 100 mSv exposure at age 40 is calculated to be 0.04 x 0.228, which is 0.009 or 0.9%. His absolute risk at age 75 from the 100 mS exposure at age 40 can be estimated to have increased from 22.8% to 23.7% (0.228 + 0.009). [41]"}

Patients with thrombophilia without other risk factors may suffer from protein S deficiency. Alternative causes of thrombophilia include other congenital coagulation abnormalities or a combination of protein S deficiency with other VTE risk factors. Protein S deficiency may also be an acquired condition, rather than congenital, due to conditions including pregnancy, vitamin K deficiency, oral contraceptives, severe hepatic dysfunction, and chronic infections. Differential diagnoses that must be considered in patients with protein S deficiency include: Antiphospholipid syndrome Antithrombin deficiency Factor 5 Leiden mutation Protein C deficiency Malignancy Prothrombin gene mutation Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [27] [28]"}

VTE induces significant morbidity and mortality. However, there is little evidence to suggest that thrombophilia related to protein S deficiency results in deteriorated prognosis for VTE.

[8] [9] Pubococcygeal line demarcates the level of the pelvic floor. The line is drawn between the inferior border of the pubic symphysis and the last intercoccygeal joint. Pelvic organ prolapse is subjectively assessed at rest, squeezing, or kegel phase, with the Valsalva maneuver, as well as the defecation phase. The degree of pelvic prolapse can be graded based on the depth of the descent below the pubococcygeal line as mild (less than 3 cm), moderate (3\u00a0to 6 cm), and severe (greater than 6 cm). [10] H- line defines the anterior-posterior width of the levator hiatus. The line is drawn between the inferior border of the pubic symphysis and the anterior wall of the rectum at the anorectal junction. The normal H- line should measure less than 5 cm. Finally, M-line measure the descendants of the levator hiatus. It is drawn perpendicular to the pubococcygeal line and intersects the inferior portion of the H-line. The normal M-line should measure less than 2 cm. H-line greater than 5 cm and M-line greater than 2 cm at rest or with the Valsalva indicates pelvic muscle weakness. The anorectal junction is an important landmark and helps in measuring the anorectal angle. The anorectal angle is the angle between the anal canal central axis and the posterior border of the distalmost portion of the rectum. The normal anorectal angle is between 108 and 127 degrees during the resting phase and denotes the functioning of the puborectalis muscle. Normally, the angle should open or become more obtuse with straining/Valsalva and defecation by approximately 20 degrees.

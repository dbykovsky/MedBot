The term hemorrhagic disorder of the newborn encompasses all hemorrhagic diseases, i.e., due to vitamin K deficiency, trauma, clotting factor deficiency, etc. When the cause is vitamin K deficiency, it is referred to as vitamin K deficiency bleeding or VKDB. Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin mainly synthesized in adults by gut bacteria. Newborns, however, have minimal vitamin K reserves in their liver during the time of delivery and are not able to synthesize vitamin K due to a sterile gut. Hence they are at risk of developing the hemorrhagic disease of the newborn. One of the main functions of vitamin K is gamma-carboxylation of coagulant factors- 2,7,9 and 10. This converts inactive clotting factors into an active state. Deficiency leads to the inadequate activity of these clotting factors, which results in bleeding.", "contents": "Hemorrhagic Disease of Newborn -- Introduction.

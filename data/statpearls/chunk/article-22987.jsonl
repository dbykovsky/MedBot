The visual deficit on the hemianopic side can be reduced with 2 prisms that are placed in the upper and lower part of the spectacle\u00a0(see Image . Peli prisms). [53] These prisms are only placed on one eye (on the side of HH)\u00a0(eg, for the right HH, these prisms are\u00a0worn over the right eye). The base of the prism is toward the hemianopic side (base out). This gives the view of objects lying on the hemianopic side\u00a0and expands the intact visual field while avoiding diplopia, which may occur if prisms are placed in the line of sight. These prisms may\u00a0include a single-mounted prism or compound Fresnel press-on prism. The expansion of the field may be quite satisfying (up to 20\u00b0 with 40 prism diopter segments and 30\u00b0 with 57 prism diopter segments). [54] [55] Variants include short segments of prism just above and below the line of sight (Peli lens, rigid polymethyl methacrylate [PMMA]-embedded prisms (see Image . PMMA-embedded prisms). [56]"}

The use of transvaginal mesh and biological graft material in prolapse surgery is controversial and has led to many inquiries into their safety and efficacy. Recently, the FDA has abandoned the use of large mesh grafts in the vagina in the correction of pelvic organ prolapse, and vaginal repair is limited to the use of either native tissue or a biological graft. [36] High-risk mesh-related complications include infection and dyspareunia. Mesh with a pore size <10 micrometers allows bacterial, but not macrophage infiltration, and can lead to high infection rates. [37]", "contents": "Pelvic Organ Prolapse -- Complications.

When a colloid cyst is diagnosed, the biggest dilemma is managing it. The minimally invasive approaches have less morbidity but a higher recurrence and reoperation rate. Removing a colloid cyst via a craniotomy has the highest up-front surgical risk but may have the lowest recurrence and reoperation rate. The open craniotomy provides more degrees of freedom for access to the colloid cyst. It may be more suitable for larger colloid cysts but does have limitations based on the approach chosen. A thorough discussion should be undertaken with the patient and let him or her decide which approach they favor.

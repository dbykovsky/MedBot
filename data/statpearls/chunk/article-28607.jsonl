Lactate is the compensatory base of lactic acid. Under aerobic physiologic conditions, the metabolism of glucose leads to the production of pyruvate into cellular respiration.

This reaction maintains NAD+ levels, even in anaerobic metabolism, to allow further glycolysis to occur in the absence of oxygen. Normally, through cellular respiration, there is always a balanced ratio of NADH/NAD+ with the transfer of protons and electrons to finally make ATP, water (H2O), and carbon dioxide (CO2) as the final products.

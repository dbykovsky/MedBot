Thus, the absolute numerical values of ScvO2 and SmvO2 are not comparable. However, the trends in change parallel one another, and therefore the trend of ScvO2 is often used as a substitute for SmvO2. Additionally, it is important to note that factors such as sedation, recent intubation, and position of the tip of the central catheter (closer to the right atrium, more\u00a0comparable to SmvO2)\u00a0must be taken into consideration when interpreting the ScvO2 values. In critical illnesses, ScvO2 is estimated to be higher than SmvO2 by 7%\u00a0+/- 4%."}

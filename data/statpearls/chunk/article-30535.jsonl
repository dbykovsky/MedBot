A patient in hypovolemic shock typically presents with hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea, and cold skin. Acute blood loss means less circulating volume and decreased organ perfusion, dependent on arterial pressure. The most vulnerable organs of decreased perfusion are the kidneys, brain, heart, liver, and colon. The body implements several processes to maintain adequate oxygenation to the previously mentioned organs. All of which the mainstay is the autonomic nervous system. One goal is to maintain cardiac output (CO), defined by heart rate x stroke volume, which is achieved by activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), causing the release of plasma catecholamines, such as vasopressin and norepinephrine, increasing the heart rate and thus CO. Another goal is to increase systemic vascular resistance (SVR); via the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Renin is released by juxtaglomerular cells in response to decreased systemic blood pressure and NaCl delivery to the macula densa. From there, renin converts to angiotensin I, angiotensin II, and aldosterone. Regarding hypovolemia, angiotensin II acts on blood vessels, causing vasoconstriction and on the hypothalamus to cause the release of the anti-diuretic hormone, leading to water reabsorption at the collecting ducts. Additionally, angiotensin II limits baroreceptor reflex bradycardia, further aiding in the maintenance of CO.

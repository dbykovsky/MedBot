[2] In feedback inhibition, products of a metabolic pathway act as inhibitors of the enzymes in that particular pathway. For example, both alanine and ATP act as non-competitive inhibitors of pyruvate kinase, the enzyme that catalyzes the final step in the glycolytic pathway. [3] The inhibition of pyruvate kinase allows cells to shut off the breakdown of glucose when adequate amounts of end-products (ATP and alanine) are present, preventing overproduction and wasting of cellular energy. Hexokinase functions in the first step of glycolysis to phosphorylate glucose, yielding\u00a0glucose-6-phosphate.

In noncompetitive inhibition, the inhibitor binds at an allosteric site separate from the active substrate binding site. Thus in noncompetitive inhibition, the inhibitor can bind its target enzyme regardless of the presence of a bound substrate. Put differently, the inhibitor has the same affinity for the enzyme and enzyme-substrate complex. The binding of the inhibitor to the enzyme or enzyme-substrate complex inactivates the enzyme, disallowing the production of its end product. Inactivation of the enzyme decreases the maximum rate of the reaction (Vmax), defined as the reaction rate at a substrate concentration that fully saturates all active sites of the specific enzyme. The Michaelis constant (Km) is the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is half Vmax. Km can also be interpreted as an inverse measurement of the enzyme-substrate affinity. In noncompetitive inhibition, the enzyme's affinity for its substrate (Km) remains unchanged as the active site is not competed for by the inhibitor. Increasing substrate concentration to overcome the decrease in Vmax caused by noncompetitive\u00a0inhibition is fruitless, as competition for the active site between inhibitor and substrate is not the limiting issue.

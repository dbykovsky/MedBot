LEMS can be a paraneoplastic syndrome or a nonparaneoplastic process resulting from an autoimmune disease. Paraneoplastic LEMS is most commonly associated with small carcinoma of the lung. Rarely, the underlying malignancy may be a non-small cell bronchogenic carcinoma, prostate cancer, or a lymphoproliferative disorder. Regardless of etiology, patients with LEMS often present with proximal lower extremity muscle weakness, dysreflexia, and autonomic dysfunction due to presynaptic inhibition of ACh release.

The size and quality of the bone harvested are also significant limiting factors in using this flap. Reconstructions that require more than 10\u00a0to 12 cm of bone, such as a total mandibulectomy, cannot be reconstructed with a single OCRFFF. The thickness of the bone is also limited. Under optimal conditions, the fibular-free flap is preferred for bony reconstructions. It offers many of the same qualities as OCRFFF; it is pliable, thin, and has a long pedicle. However, it has the added advantage of greater bone stock thickness, and most\u00a0lower extremity weight-bearing is on the tibia, not the fibula. The fibular free flap similarly requires that blood flow to the distal extremity (ie, the foot) be sufficient after the loss of the contribution of the peroneal artery.

Surgeon experience, operative technique, and vessel geometry are important factors that contribute to success or failure. Flap failure can be arterial or venous. Situations in which vessel geometry may lead to kinking, obstruction, or excessive tension should be avoided. Thoughtful flap inset is particularly important when mucosal incisions are being sealed to avoid the effects of a potential salivary fistula on the microvascular anastomosis. However, even in a smooth, well-scripted surgical procedure, many patient and patient care factors can contribute to a failed free flap intraoperatively and/or postoperatively. Identifying and avoiding those factors is key to reducing complications and length of hospitalization. Early recognition of flap failure may also salvage a compromised flap; otherwise, secondary or replacement reconstruction may be necessary. In a study by Mirzabeigi et al, they reviewed a series of 2260 microvascular flaps with a 3% take-back rate for delayed microvascular compromise and a 49% salvage rate.

The current effectiveness of these methods is still equivocal, and this area requires further research. There are four principal modes of electrical stimulation; the direct current reduces\u00a0osteoclast activity and increases osteoblast activity by creating an alkaline tissue environment and reducing oxygen concentration. In contrast, the alternating current (AC) affects collagen synthesis and cartilage calcification. The other two types are magnetic, either pulsed electromagnetic fields that result in the calcification of fibrocartilage or combined magnetic fields that increase the concentrations of transforming growth factor beta and bone morphogenic proteins. [48] Ultrasound such as (LIPUS) low-intensity pulsed ultrasound has been reported to augment fracture healing and increase the strength of the formed callus, with healing rates in non-union and delayed unions approaching 80%. LIPUS improves fracture healing\u00a0by increasing chondrocytes, soft callus formation, and, consequently, earlier endochondral ossification.

The EAST Clinical Management Update in 2010 did not have any level I recommendations for damage control approach in trauma. [19] (20539186). However, they did make a level III recommendation that a damage control approach could be considered in the setting of acidosis, hypothermia, coagulopathy, and massive transfusion (20539186).

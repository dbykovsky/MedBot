Initially, meticulous skills are required for identifying risk factors and conducting a thorough medical assessment. This involves collaboration among healthcare professionals, including a surgeon well-versed in facial aesthetics, medical optimization for anesthesia, and an ophthalmologist or optometrist evaluation to address potential visual concerns. Responsibility falls on a specialized preoperative, operative, and postoperative nurse who monitors patients and aids in care coordination and patient education. An interprofessional team comprising a facial surgeon, anesthesia provider, and operative nurse should conduct the procedure to achieve optimal outcomes. Subsequent close follow-up is crucial to monitor for potential complications, and patients should receive counseling on wound care and activity levels. Such interprofessional care is paramount in achieving the best results in facial reconstructive surgeries like direct brow lifting, embodying the principles of skill, strategy, ethics, responsibility, interprofessional communication, and care coordination.", "contents": "Direct Brow Lift -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

There are over 1300 different species of ginger root plants. Its strong aroma and taste are due to ketones called gingerols, a primary component of the root.

Gingerols, shogaols, and paradols are the three major active components from terpenes found in ginger, and the suggested serving size ranges from 170mg to 1g of powder a day.\u00a0A primary metabolite of gingerol is known as (S)-[6]-gingerol-4\u2019- 0 -\u03b2-glucuronide.

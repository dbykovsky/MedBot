Perhaps even more\u00a0crucial is impressing upon patients the importance of corneal protection during the period of flaccid paralysis because the temporary nature of the facial palsy does not preclude the possibility of sustaining a permanent ocular injury during that interval. Accordingly, the application of artificial tears throughout the day and ocular lubricant ointment at night, and the use of eyelid stretching and taping can mean the difference between a satisfactory long-term outcome and an unsatisfactory one. It is also important for patients with active vesicles to avoid contact with unvaccinated and immunocompromised individuals, as they can spread the varicella-zoster virus from their lesions. Lastly, administering the shingles vaccine\u00a0likely prevents\u00a0Ramsay Hunt syndrome as well, but the vaccine is not 100% effective. It is also important to remember that while most patients will not develop chickenpox or zoster more than once, it has been reported, particularly in immunocompromised individuals.

When discussing Ramsay Hunt syndrome with patients, it is essential to emphasize that everyone gets better, but not everyone gets all the way better. Explaining that \"not all the way better\" may involve synkinesis and/or postherpetic neuralgia is critical.

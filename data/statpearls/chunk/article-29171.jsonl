Their venom contains enzymes that cause local destruction of tissue through the metabolism of cellular membranes and cause an inflammatory response. Systemic effects and coagulopathy from cottonmouth envenomation are uncommon. The most common symptoms are pain, ecchymosis, and edema. Crotalidae polyvalent immune Fab antivenom should be administered for patients exhibiting progressive signs of proximal edema, significant hematologic abnormalities, or severe systemic symptoms. Patients with early signs of envenomation require admission for observation. Those who do not have symptoms after\u00a08 hours can be discharged.", "contents": "Water Moccasin Snake Toxicity -- Pearls and Other Issues.

If antivenom is necessary, it will be obtained from the pharmacy, and the pharmacists should be sure to familiarize themselves with the interaction and adverse event profile since it is an infrequently encountered agent; this will enable them to be a better asset to the care team.

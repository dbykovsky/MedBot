When administering tadalafil, it is crucial to closely monitor the cardiovascular status of patients due to the drug's effect on\u00a0blood pressure. Regular monitoring of blood pressure is recommended, particularly for those on antihypertensive medications, as tadalafil can\u00a0enhance the blood pressure-lowering effects of these medications. [45] Immediate reporting of changes in vision or hearing, such as sudden loss or decrease, is important as these could signify serious adverse effects. The occurrence of priapism, a prolonged erection, requires awareness and prompt medical attention. Monitoring is also vital for patients with significant hepatic or renal impairment, considering the metabolism and excretion pathways of tadalafil. It is important to be vigilant for signs of hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, hives, and swelling, especially of the lips, tongue, or throat. Continuous monitoring for potential drug interactions is essential, particularly with drugs affecting CYP3A4, nitrates, and \u03b1-blockers. [46] Assessing tadalafil's efficacy in treating erectile dysfunction or benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms is crucial in\u00a0determining the therapeutic approach. A\u00a0periodic evaluation of patient tolerance, focusing on side effects like headache, back pain, and dyspepsia, is important for maintaining quality of life during treatment."}

The elastic tissue of blood vessel walls contains elastin only, without microfibrillar support. The elastin is organized into fenestrated lamellae in concentric rings between layers of myocytes. A unique feature of these fibers is the ability to stretch up to 50% of their length before recoiling to their original length after deformation. This characteristic enables elastin within the tunica media of arteries to facilitate pressure wave propagation of blood flow, particularly in large elastic blood vessels such as the aorta and pulmonary arteries. This property, known as the Windkessel effect, maintains relatively uniform arterial blood pressure, despite pulsatile blood flow. [1]", "contents": "Histology, Verhoeff Stain -- Function.

The Verhoeff staining process occurs in two steps. The initial stage is the Verhoeff stain component, using hematoxylin, iron (III) chloride and an iodine solution. Iron (III) chloride and iodine act as mordants and aid in the oxidation of hematoxylin to hematein, which is responsible for staining elastic elements. Elastin possesses a strong affinity for the hematoxylin-iron complex and thus, retains the stain longer than other tissue elements following decolorization. Excess iron (III) chloride is used to differentiate the tissue; then sodium thiosulfate is used to remove excess iodine. The subsequent van Gieson counterstain utilizes picric acid and acid fuchsin to stain collagen and muscle fibers, producing contrast against the hematoxylin stain. Under-differentiation is preferred in the Verhoeff stain, as picric acid used in the van Gieson counterstain serves to differentiate the elastic fibers further. Each slide must be differentiated individually as the appropriate duration of differentiation varies according to the amount of elastic tissue in each specimen, which may make preparation difficult.

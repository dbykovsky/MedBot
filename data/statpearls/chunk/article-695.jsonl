Temporally, a sequential series of changes can be observed in myocardial infarction, beginning with the waviness of myocardial fibers, coagulation necrosis, myocardial edema, focal hemorrhage, and neutrophilic infiltration. This is followed by\u00a0ongoing coagulation necrosis\u00a0and pallor due to shrunken cells and contraction band necrosis.\u00a0Subsequently, there is\u00a0loss of striation (around 8 hours) and further necrosis\u00a0with continued neutrophilic infiltration. This cascade\u00a0of events leads to\u00a0the disintegration of myocardial fibers and subsequent phagocytosis, resulting in a soft yellow-brown core\u00a0surrounded by a\u00a0hyperemic border. After complete phagocytosis, granulation tissue formation occurs along with neo-vascularization and a fibrous reaction (around 14 days), ultimately forming an organized fibrous scar (approximately 3 months)."}

These polyps can be very small (a few mm) or present as giant polyps (>4 cm) and may present as a single polyp or multiple polyps. Patients with endometrial polyps can be asymptomatic or can present with AUB. Due to its pro-estrogen effects, patients on tamoxifen therapy for breast cancer are more likely to acquire endometrial polyps (and hyperplasia). These polyps are generally benign but have a small potential of becoming malignant. [14]"}

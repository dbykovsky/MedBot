Due to the significant morbidity associated with PCV, timely diagnosis and management are necessary to preserve vision. Sudden onset of diminution in vision or distortion of vision must be evaluated with OCT and started on anti-VEGF therapy to prevent the onset of fibrosis and permanent scarring. Patients must be educated about treatment compliance. Treatment such as PDT or thermal laser may reduce or eliminate the need for monthly intravitreal injections, thereby reducing the cost of treatment to the patients. Educators should stress to patients that any worsening of vision in either eye needs to be assessed promptly because delays in treatment can lead to irreversible vision loss.", "contents": "Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy -- Deterrence and Patient Education.

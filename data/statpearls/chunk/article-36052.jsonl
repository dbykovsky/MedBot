Recent studies have shown that the SGLT2 inhibitor, empagliflozin (EMPA), and the GLP-1 receptor agonist, liraglutide, reduce significant cardiovascular (CV) events and mortality. Hence, in patients with CV disease, these drugs should be considered next. For patients with T1DM, a regime of basal-bolus insulin is the mainstay of therapy. Also, insulin pump therapy is a reasonable choice. Since hypoglycemia portends increased mortality, preference should be given to therapies that do not induce hypoglycemia, for example, DPP-4 Inhibitors, SGLT-2 inhibitors, GLP-I receptor agonists, and pioglitazone with metformin.

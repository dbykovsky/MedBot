[35]", "contents": "Anatomy, Shoulder and Upper Limb, Elbow Annular Ligament -- Clinical Significance. Monteggia fracture-dislocations\u00a0are relatively rare injuries in the pediatric population. Although forearm fractures are the most common fracture in the pediatric population, Monteggia\u00a0fracture-dislocations constitute only about\u00a01% of all pediatric forearm fractures. [32] [33] [32] These injuries\u00a0have a proximal one-third of the ulna (olecranon) fracture with an associated radial head dislocation from the annular ligament. Mechanisms of injury include a fall on an outstretched hand with excessive forearm pronation and less commonly, direct trauma on the dorsal surface of the proximal forearm. These injuries commonly require surgical intervention given the high incidence of long-term elbow dysfunction following either missed injury or following suboptimal clinical management. [34] Surgical management consists of open reduction\u00a0internal fixation of the\u00a0proximal ulna. Upon restoration of ulnar length and stability, the radial\u00a0head\u00a0can be\u00a0reduced with\u00a0a restoration of the anatomic relationship between the radial head, capitellum, and the annular ligament.

In the study by Shokri et al., ventilation time and ICU stay were reported to be significantly shorter in the group that received a TTMPB. [4] Zhang et al. 2021. reported similar results for these same two variables. [13] The TTMPB's analgesic potential has been shown to be great, as it has been described to be able to completely relieve poststernotomy pain and prevent reintubation in at least one case report.

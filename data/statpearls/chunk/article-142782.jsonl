CSX further causes a prominent decline in a patient's quality of life and difficulties in daily activities. The diagnosis of CSX is one of exclusion which further prompts extensive workup and assessment that can be costly and time-consuming. The challenge of achieving therapeutic efficacy from pharmacotherapy also poses additional barriers as traditional therapy for managing anginal chest pain is often unsuccessful. This often prolongs CSX symptoms, prompts hospital admissions, restraining daily activities, and inability to attend work."}

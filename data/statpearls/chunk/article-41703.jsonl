Unlike the active shooter incidents usually conducted by\u00a01 or\u00a02 individuals, in an HTV attack, many individuals are well trained, know how to operate a variety of weapons, and are willing to die. Most HTV attacks may involve small groups of attackers in different locations. Furthermore, these individuals also manage to\u00a0communicate with others in the group. The key feature of an HTV attack is that attracting the first responders is involved so that more damage\u00a0is inflicted. For example, in the Middle East, both Israelis and Palestinians have been known to engage in open-air violence in areas where they live together. Similarly, violence can be seen in parts of the Bronx in New York City or Compton in Los Angeles, as well as in other parts of the US."}

[24] Of note, caution should be taken when antipsychotics are used with other\u00a0QT-prolonging\u00a0medications. Other commonly used classes of drugs that are associated with QT prolongation include, but are not limited to, antiarrhythmics, antibiotics, antiemetics, and antidepressants, as well as methadone, lithium, octreotide, and tacrolimus, among others. A baseline EKG and further assessment may be warranted. Antipsychotics can also induce extrapyramidal symptoms (EPSs) expressed as\u00a0parkinsonism featuring dystonic reactions or akathisia. [25] Rarely, haloperidol can cause neuroleptic malignant syndrome [26] ,\u00a0whereas insomnia and agitation can often be observed. In the case of atypical antipsychotics, EPSs can manifest at high doses. Again, olanzapine and quetiapine may induce excessive sedation, whereas ziprasidone is more associated with QT prolongation."}

The diffuse form\u00a0is further categorized into 3 stages according to the extent of involvement in the nearby tissues. [63] Focal: Involvement is localized within the cortex of the kidney, observed in about 20% of cases. Segmental: Involvement is limited to a regional or segmental area of the kidney. Diffuse: The most common presentation,\u00a0characterized by widespread and diffuse renal involvement. Stage 1 (Nephric): The disease is limited to the kidney. Stage 2 (Perinephric): The disease involves the renal pelvis or the perinephric fat within Gerota's fascia. Stage 3 (Paranephric): The disease involves a wider area, including adjacent organs or the retroperitoneum. [46] [63] [64]"}

Efficacy may depend on many factors including the degree of patency of the labyrinthine artery and the ability to increase oxygen tension in the perilymph.

The best results are found when patients are treated within 14 days of symptoms onset and with concomitant steroids (either systemically or intratympanic).

Patients with moderate to severe hearing loss (more than 40 decibels) should be considered for hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

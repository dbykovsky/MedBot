[31] [32] [23]", "contents": "Gas Gangrene -- Treatment / Management. It is crucial to get early surgical consultation without delay in the case of gas gangrene, as this is an immediate emergency.\u00a0 Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be initiated without any delay to get cultures. Reasonable coverage should include vancomycin, tazobactam or a carbapenem, or a third-generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone) with metronidazole. Moreover, in case of any suspicion for gas gangrene or necrotizing fascitis, penicillin plus clindamycin should be added to cover group A streptococcal necrotizing fasciitis. Clindamycin is strongly recommended. Adjunctive measures in the treatment of gas gangrene include hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy.\u00a0 The function of the existing toxin is not affected by hyperbaric oxygen therapy; thus, debridement is of paramount importance. Hemodynamically unstable patients may not be candidates for HBO therapy. Moreover, animal experimental studies in animals failed to document the therapeutic efficacy of HBO. [31] [32] [23]"}

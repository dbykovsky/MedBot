Lacunar infarcts are small infarcts. The prognosis should understandably be better compared with cortical infarcts. The prognosis for lacunar infarctions is better than other types of strokes.\u00a0Multiple population-based epidemiological studies on lacunar infarcts have shown significantly better survival among patients who suffered from lacunar infarctions than those who suffered from non-lacunar infarcts. [7] [19] These studies showed a case fatality of 0% to 3% within the first month and 3% to 9% within the first year, compared with 14% and 28%, respectively."}

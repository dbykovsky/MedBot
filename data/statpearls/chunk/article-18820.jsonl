Arterioles vary from 8 to 60 micrometers in diameter and may even further subdivide into meta-arterioles. [2] All arteries possess a basic structure consisting of three layers: a tunica intima, tunica media, and tunica adventitia. [3] In addition to carrying metabolites to the capillaries, arterioles also play a significant role in maintaining peripheral vascular resistance mediated by input from the autonomic nervous system. [2] On the other side of the capillary, venules are thin-walled vessels mainly composed of endothelial cells. They function in receiving capillary blood containing tissue waste products and destining them to be processed by other organs. Also, post-capillary venules facilitate leukocyte diapedesis and plasma protein leakage during times of inflammation. While it has been shown that venules may also partake in fluid and nutrient exchange, the capillary primarily assumes the task. [4]", "contents": "Histology, Capillary -- Structure.

Furthermore, arterioles can also dictate exchange in the capillary through the regulation of bloodflow. Arteriolar contraction decreases flow to the capillary, whereas arteriolar dilation will increase flow. Arterioles can also shunt blood via metarterioles to post-capillary venules, completely bypassing the capillary unit altogether.

[1] Loop diuretics, including furosemide, torsemide, and bumetanide, are the most potent diuretic class. They can be used alone or in conjunction with other types of diuretics. There are two strategies in terms of diuresis: either a continuous infusion dose or using intravenous boluses. Creatinine clearance can be used to help determine the dosage. For example, treatment can start with a loading dose of 40 mg intravenous furosemide loading dose followed by 10 mg/hr if the creatinine clearance is between 25 and 75 mL/min. In contrast, one can start with 80 mg to 160 mg of intravenous furosemide as a maximum dose that can be repeated several times a day to achieve a desirable response for the same creatinine clearance.

However, using the continuous infusion strategy would give clinicians more opportunities to evaluate the response to therapy.

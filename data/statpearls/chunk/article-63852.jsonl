[34] A similar reduction in infection rate was noted by other authors who trained participants on sterile technique to central line insertion using a video or simulator and showed that those using a simulator also had a reduction of 70% in the incidence of catheter-related infections. [35] They suggested that simulation should be implemented for trainees to reduce iatrogenic risk. Studies in the field of OBGYN showed simulation for obstetric emergencies was associated with a reduction in low Apgar scores (less than 6) at 5 minutes, improved neonatal outcomes in patients with shoulder dystocia, and a reduction of neonatal injury. [36] [37] [38] A study in general surgery demonstrated that randomization to a mastery learning group who trained to high standards was associated with performing faster extraperitoneal hernia repairs (34 min vs. 48 min), higher performance scores intraoperatively (21.9 vs. 18.3), and fewer intraoperative and postoperative complications. [39] While these findings of improved patient outcomes seem to be most robust in procedural teaching, its impact across specialties demonstrates the utility of training on a simulator to pre-defined standards."}

Regular medical follow-up is essential for monitoring disease progression, treatment response, and early detection of complications. Pharmacological therapy is central to managing pulmonary hypertension to improve symptoms and delay disease progression. Treatments may include oxygen supplementation and diuretic and anticoagulant intake.

Vigilance is imperative, especially in people with a family history of pulmonary hypertension. Patients must be educated about the potential for a delay in diagnosis, which may require visiting multiple doctors across various institutions before arriving at a definitive diagnosis. The experience can evoke feelings of anxiety and frustration. Additionally, patients may undergo extensive testing, including blood tests, PFTs, sleep studies, echocardiograms, and RHC, to aid in the diagnostic process.

Most surgical adrenal samples obtained for analysis in patients with HCM are typically in the setting of ACTH independent adrenal HCM. The histopathologic findings can range from diffuse adrenal hyperplasia to micro or macronodular adrenal hyperplasia, lone adrenal incidentaloma lesions (often benign adrenal adenomas) to adrenocortical carcinomas. [17] [13] The distinction between micro and macronodular adrenal disease has its basis on the macroscopic size of the nodules; nodules\u00a0greater than 1 cm are macronodules, and those under 1 cm are micronodules. The coexistence of macro and micronodules within the same specimen is common. Awareness of the distinctive micronodular hyperplasia of primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical hyperplasia (PPNAD) and its association with a paradoxical cortisol response on the 6\u00a0to 8 day Liddle's test as well with Carney complex is important. Recognition of the unique form of bilateral macronodular adrenocortical hyperplasia (BMAH) associated with the McCune-Albright syndrome is also important. [18] [19] [20]"}

Patients with NF1\u00a0are at high risk of developing\u00a0both benign and malignant tumors.\u00a0Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs)\u00a0occur in about 2% to 5% of NF1\u00a0patients. [13] They\u00a0are high-grade sarcomas and originate from tissues of mesenchymal origin. A rapid change in the size of a preexisting neurofibroma, unremitting pain, intralesional hemorrhage, and infiltration of the adjacent structures\u00a0indicate a possible malignant transformation to MPNST. The malignant transformation of a neurofibroma has an extremely poor prognosis with recurrences and distant metastasis. Studies have shown the average 5-year survival rate for these patients ranges from 16% to 52%. [31] Hence, patients with neurofibromatosis should be closely monitored for possible malignancy\u00a0as this\u00a0sarcomatous change in a neurofibroma has an extremely poor prognosis."}

Unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis is 7 times more common than pheochromocytoma.

The overall risk of malignancy in patients with NF1 is 5% to 15% greater when compared to the general population.  Plexiform neurofibromas are a frequent complication of NF1 and may lead to the site of development of malignant nerve sheath tumors. The most commonly affected regions are the paraspinal, sacral plexus, sciatic notch, and perirectal regions. Optic nerve gliomas can result in vision loss and even morbidity in young children. Symptomatic gliomas usually manifest before 6 yrs of age with loss of visual acuity or proptosis. Diagnosis of this entity will be challenging in preverbal children, and hence screening in early childhood is crucial to early detection and intervention.

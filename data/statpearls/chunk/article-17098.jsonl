Many people with acne conglobata develop depression and anxiety. Once the diagnosis is made, these individuals should receive psychological counseling. The tendency is for these patients to hide the body disfigurement and skin lesions with garments, often leading to excess warmth and humidity, which worsens the skin condition. Hence,\u00a0clinicians and nurses should\u00a0educate the patient on skin hygiene and recommend\u00a0counseling. In more severe cases, starting these patients on antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications can also be helpful. [23] [Level\u00a05]"}

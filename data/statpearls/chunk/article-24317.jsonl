There are many disorders of fat metabolism that present with serious and specific characteristics but are not discussed here as they are beyond the scope of lipolysis, specifically. These include, but are not limited to, fatty acid oxidation disorders (FAODs) such as MCAD deficiency or primary carnitine deficiency and peroxisomal disorders such as Zellweger syndrome and adrenoleukodystrophy."}

These changes include increased basal rates of lipolysis, which may promote the development of insulin resistance and also diminished responsiveness to stimulated lipolysis. [9] The combination of enhanced lipolysis and impaired lipogenesis ultimately promotes insulin resistance due to the release of cytokines and lipid metabolites. Furthermore, adipose tissue of insulin-resistant people displays a lack of proteins involved in mitochondrial function. Mitochondria-derived energy sources function in lipogenesis in adipose tissue.

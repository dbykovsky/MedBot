IOPs categorize training outcomes according to attitudes, behaviors, and cognitions and identify opportunities to measure each of these independently. For example, a common strategy among simulation educators is to measure course effectiveness along with participant self-report attitudes (e.g., \u201cI found this course helpful,\u201d \u201cI feel more confident performing these procedures,\u201d \u201cI plan to apply principles from this course to my practice.\u201d) Integration of IOP principles would ensure that the course is measured not only according to participant satisfaction and reactions, but also regarding increases in cognitive outcomes (procedural steps, when to use certain techniques, etc.) and actual behaviors (improvements in hands-on skills, retention, and transfer to the actual clinical environment). Finally, given that the primary placement of IOPs is in business settings, IOPs are well-suited to partner with simulation educators to document the return on investment of simulation activities. Aside from course effectiveness, measuring outcomes such as onboarding rates, task efficiency, opportunity costs, 360-degree ratings, differences across learner groups, and skill or knowledge transfer to new settings may be areas where IOPs have additional input and expertise.", "contents": "Industrial and Organizational Psychology in Medical Simulation  -- Issues of Concern.

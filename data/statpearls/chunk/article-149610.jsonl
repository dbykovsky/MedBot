Patients should be educated that discontinuing acitretin will rapidly return the rate of SCC formation to baseline. [40] Other potential chemoprophylaxis measures can be considered if acitretin is contraindicated or poorly tolerated. Other chemoprophylactic options include photodynamic therapy or topical chemoprophylaxis with retinoids, 5-fluorouracil, imiquimod, ingenol mebutate, or diclofenac.\u00a0Of these options, 5-fluorouracil and imiquimod have the strongest level of evidence for use.

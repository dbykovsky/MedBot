It is best done with an interprofessional team that includes an internist, endocrinologist, diabetes nurse educator, primary care provider, gastroenterologist, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists. Specialty nurses play the crucial role of assisting clinicians with patient education and monitoring at regular intervals to ensure adequate control of symptoms. A diabetes nurse educator can assist the clinical team by educating the patient on adequate glycemic control to prevent the progression of this disease. Clinical pharmacists are essential in monitoring patients for adverse reactions from therapy and to limit potential drug-drug interactions.

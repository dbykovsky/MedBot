In acute nickel carbonyl poisoning cases, diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC) has been considered an antidote. For critically ill patients, DDC can be administered parenterally at a dose of 12.5 mg/kg IV and should be initiated early in the course of poisoning. In cases where urine nickel levels are equal to or greater than 10 mg/dL, oral dosing of DDC at 1 g can be considered. However, it is essential to note that further research is needed to establish the efficacy and safety of chelation therapy in nickel toxicity."}

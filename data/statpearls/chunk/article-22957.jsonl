Treatment of\u00a0Hodgkin lymphoma\u00a0is based on clinical staging of the disease. The modified Ann Arbor staging system is the most common. The staging system for\u00a0Hodgkin lymphoma\u00a0is based on the location of lymphadenopathy, the number and size of the lymph node, and whether the extranodal lymph node involvement is shown systemic. The commonly used staging system divides the disease into\u00a0four stages: Stage I: Involvement of single lymph node regions or lymphoid structure Stage II: Involvement of\u00a02 or more lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm; the number of anatomic sites should be indicated in a suffix (e.g., II2) Stage III: Involvement of lymph nodes or structures on both sides of the diaphragm III1: With or without splenic, hilar, celiac, or portal nodes III2: With paraaortic, iliac or mesenteric nodes Stage IV: Involvement of extranodal sites beyond those designated as E (E: single extranodal site, or contiguous or proximal to the known nodal site of disease)"}

This can lead to pericarditis, valvular heart disease, and coronary artery disease. In addition, drugs like anthracyclines can cause cardiomyopathy. Pulmonary disease can result from drugs like bleomycin and radiation therapy. Secondary cancers are a common cause of morbidity and mortality. The most common secondary malignancy following treatment of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma is lung cancer. Myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia is also of major concern following alkylation therapy. Other cancers that may develop include breast, soft tissue sarcoma, pancreatic, and thyroid. Infertility varies but occurs in over 50% of patients. Infectious complications do occur but can be managed with empirical antibiotic treatment. Finally, patients may develop depression, peripheral neuropathy, family issues, and disturbed sexual functioning.", "contents": "Hodgkin Lymphoma -- Complications.

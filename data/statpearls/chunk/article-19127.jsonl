Carefully remove the syringe and thread the guidewire through the introducer needle hub. The guidewire should only be inserted beyond the anticipated catheter length, avoiding intracardiac advancement. The telemetry monitor should be carefully watched to identify any arrhythmias induced by the guidewire. If an arrhythmia does occur, the guidewire should be pulled back until it resolves.

[23] The average distance to the cavoatrial junction from the right subclavian access site, the left subclavian access site, and the left internal jugular access site are 18.4 cm, 21.2 cm, and 19.1 cm, respectively.

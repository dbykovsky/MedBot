Alternatively, some muscle can be included with the flap, thereby avoiding this time-consuming and challenging step of perforator isolation. The motor nerve to vastus lateralis accompanies the descending branch of LCFA and must be preserved, although branches entering any muscle harvested may be included. Further proximal dissection of the LCFA is carried out depending on the length of the pedicle required for anastomosis with the recipient vessels. Another critical point to note in the proximal dissection is that the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve is usually found proximally along a line connecting the ASIS to the superolateral patellar border. This nerve must be preserved if not harvesting a sensory flap."}

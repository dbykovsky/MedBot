If elevated, the patient should be moved to a sitting position with their legs dangling, and any constricting clothing or binders should be loosened. A careful check should be made for the initiating stimulus, which most often is a distended bladder. The majority of these patients will have Foley catheters which can easily become kinked or obstructed, so this should be checked first by either irrigation or by changing the catheter. Patients without urinary catheters should immediately have a Foley placed. If no treatable initiating cause is discovered, it should be treated as a hypertensive emergency as the patient is at high risk for a potentially life-threatening stroke if the blood pressure remains uncontrolled. In such situations, immediate, emergency treatment of the hypertensive crisis is most easily accomplished by applying 1 to 2 inches of 2% nitroglycerine paste directly to the skin above the level of the spinal injury or nifedipine 10 mg. using a \"bite and swallow\" technique.", "contents": "Autonomic Dysreflexia -- Pearls and Other Issues.

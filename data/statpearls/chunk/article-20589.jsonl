In particular, extension loss is the most common and is usually related to the time of immobilization in a static splint. Greater than 25 days of immobilization can lead to a loss of 30 degrees in extension and nearly 20 degrees in flexion. Extrinsic causes may be due to flexion contracture of the anterior capsule, or contracture of the collateral ligaments and the surrounding musculature. [17] Contracture of the anterior capsule is the most common cause of extension block due to fibrosis of the capsule. [15] Intrinsic causes, such as articular incongruency or fragments that cause a mechanical block, could also cause loss of motion. [17]", "contents": "Elbow Dislocation -- Complications.

Median nerve involvement after closed reduction requires open exploration. In patients that have an observed neuropraxia, electromyography is ordered only after three months of persistent symptoms.

An anesthetic agent that does affect seizure duration might be desirable if the patients' previous seizure during ECT was too long or short. Muscle relaxation protects the musculoskeletal system from the tonic and clonic actions of a generalized seizure. There are enough options and ways to provide anesthesia for ECT to suit most patients' needs. Alterations are made by the anesthesiologist, who recognizes reactions, patient discomfort, and side effects. Today, ECT is seldom performed without the use of general anesthesia except in developing countries. Musculoskeletal injury and post-traumatic stress disorder are not uncommon when enduring ECT without anesthesia.

Additionally, this allows the anesthetic provider to determine if the patient's comorbidities and current medication regimen require alterations to the anesthetic plan. The anesthesia team should also coordinate with the psychiatrist to determine the severity of the patient's psychiatric disorders and the length of seizure desired.

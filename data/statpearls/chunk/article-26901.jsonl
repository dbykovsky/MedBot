Repairing the non-coronal distal hypospadias might be performed via either the Mathieu technique\u00a0or the tubularized incised plate urethroplasty (TIP). Patient selection for these techniques should also be precise, which means those patients with even distal but thin meatus extending to the penoscrotal junction are not appropriate choices for the technique. Another exclusion criteria for utilizing the TIP or Mathieu technique would be a high grade of ventral curvature of more than 30 degrees, which should be characterized following complete degloving. These patients with excessive chordee should be approached via proximal hypospadias repair techniques. Also, previously considered as a contraindication for TIP repair, the narrow urethral plates equivalent to\u00a0an average of 6 mm prior to incision are now candidates\u00a0for distal TIP repair. [17] [18] [19] A few modifications have been added to the original TIP; for instance, grafting to fill the defect following the incision might result in improved outcomes without a significant increase in specific complications, including meatal stenosis or urethral strictures. [20] Utilizing TIP might not be limited to the distal hypospadias, as it can be used for even more proximal cases of midshaft or proximal hypospadias. The major consideration in those patients would be the final degree of ventral curvature after complete degloving, which should be less than 30 degrees."}

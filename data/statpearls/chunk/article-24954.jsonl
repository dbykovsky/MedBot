[30] Menarche can be delayed in normally developing females due to abnormalities of the female genitourinary tract.\u00a0Females with an imperforate hymen may present with delayed menarche and often have a history of recurrent cyclic abdominal or pelvic pain. These patients may present with a palpable lower abdominal mass and often have a bulging, bluish-colored hymen. [31] The absence of a normal uterus or vagina due to M\u00fcllerian agenesis, or Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome, has an incidence of approximately 1/4500 females and often goes undiagnosed until a patient\u00a0presents with primary amenorrhea. Other complex hormonal abnormalities, such as androgen insensitivity syndrome, can present with external female development\u00a0and primary amenorrhea. Abnormal development of female gonads due to Turner syndrome\u00a0also can lead to ovarian agenesis and absent menses. [32]"}

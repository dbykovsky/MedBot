Transvaginal imaging to measure endometrial thickness may also be used as a first-line modality to evaluate PMB in patients without indications for histologic assessment. The technique ACOG recommends to measure endometrial thickness consists of using the thickest portion of the endometrial stripe seen on a\u00a0long-axis uterine view, measuring anterior to posterior. [5] An endometrial stripe thickness of\u00a0\u22644 mm has a negative predictive value >99% for endometrial carcinoma. [35] The probability of having endometrial cancer with an endometrial stripe thickness of <4 mm is approximately 0.3%. Using this 4 mm threshold, only 1 in 339 endometrial cancers are missed, according to studies. [5] Ultrasound imaging may also identify other pathologic pelvic etiologies (eg, leiomyomas or adnexal masses). However, further evaluation with endometrial sampling is indicated if the endometrial stripe is inadequately visualized. Because endometrial imaging is not diagnostic and endometrial thickness does not always exclude malignancy, clinicians should perform an endometrial biopsy for continued or recurrent PMB, even for patients with an endometrial lining <4 mm.

However, several special clinical indications exist for possible procedural intervention, which is done on a case-by-case basis.\u00a0Ipsilateral hemodynamic symptoms in the setting of ipsilateral ICA occlusion and contralateral ICA stenosis may benefit from contralateral ICA revascularization to ameliorate hemodynamic insufficiency.\u00a0Ipsilateral embolic symptoms in the setting of ipsilateral ICA occlusion and ipsilateral external carotid occlusion\u00a0(ECA) stenosis may be treated with ipsilateral ECA revascularization to eliminate the source of embolization, which occurs via enlarged ECA collaterals. Ligation of the ipsilateral ICA can also eliminate a source for embolization. [21] [22] [23]"}

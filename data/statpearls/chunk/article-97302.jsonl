With this in mind, the majority of patients that present with a primary tongue squamous cell carcinoma must be offered a neck dissection to pathologically rule out occult nodal metastasis (termed an elective neck dissection) or to surgically remove the clinically evident nodal disease. When there is no clinical or radiologic evidence of neck disease but an ipsilateral elective neck dissection is warranted, a selective dissection of levels I-III, also called a supraomohyoid neck dissection, is usually employed. [14] On the other hand, when there is gross evidence of neck disease either preoperatively or intraoperatively, an ipsilateral modified radical neck dissection is recommended."}

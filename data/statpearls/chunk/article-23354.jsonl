The standard dosage is typically 1.2 g/m\u00b2/d, administered slowly over 30 minutes for 5 consecutive days. [2] Before administering each dose, it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive assessment, including a complete blood cell count with differential, evaluation of renal and liver function, assessment of urine output, and urinalysis. Dosing is repeated every 3 weeks or after hematological recovery. Drug levels can be measured in urine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. [33] Therapeutic drug monitoring takes place after assessing the pharmacokinetics of the first course of the drug, and subsequent dosage adjustments are made due to the considerable variability in ifosfamide's pharmacokinetics."}

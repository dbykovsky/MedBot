Relaxation of the cell occurs when calcium levels return to their original values mainly via uptake by the SR through SERCA. Calcium further extrudes from the cell via Na/Ca exchanger (NCX) and mitochondrial calcium uptake. [3] A strong myocardium contraction occurs when more calcium binds to troponin-C to bind more actin and myosin. The self-regulating NCX in the myocyte regulates cellular calcium. During the initial diastolic phase, there is a quick influx of both calcium and sodium into the cell via the NCX, followed by the calcium efflux phase. With increased heart rate, calcium efflux is limited, allowing it to bias calcium movement towards troponin-C and sarcoplasmic reticulum instead of movement through the NCX. As the heart rate slows or intracellular sodium concentration falls, calcium efflux is more pronounced. Calcium gets depleted from troponin-C and the sarcoplasmic reticulum, resulting in a fall of the myocardium\u2019s contractility strength.

However, augmented sensitivity of myofilaments to calcium by myosin light chain phosphorylation leads to further enhanced phosphorylation, which happens when the calcium released from SR binds to calmodulin, activating the myosin light chain kinase. With each subsequent stimulation of skeletal muscle fiber, phosphorylation of the myosin light chain persists as the phosphatase activity is slower than the kinase. [5] The staircase effect in the muscle has a similar concept to the Bowditch effect in the myocardium but is not referred to as the Bowditch effect as Bowditch had specifically described the effect in the cardiac myocyte. This differentiation can be because, with increased frequency, more skeletal muscle fibers can be engaged to amplify the contraction. Further, while only intracellular calcium is involved in muscle contraction of skeletal muscle, the heart also uses extracellular calcium. Additionally, all the cardiac fibers are engaged in every beat and cannot recruit more fibers to increase contraction force. [3]", "contents": "Physiology, Bowditch Effect -- Organ Systems Involved.

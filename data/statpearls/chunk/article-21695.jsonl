{"id": "article-21695_3", "title": "Fentanyl Transdermal -- Mechanism of Action", "content": "Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid agonist, which acts primarily at the \u03bc-opioid receptor. It is 100 times more potent than morphine resulting in an estimated conversion ratio of 1 to 100 to provide an equal degree of analgesia. Its low molecular weight, high potency, and lipid solubility make it ideal for delivery via the transdermal route. After absorption and entrance into circulation, fentanyl can exert potent effects on areas of the brain that are highly responsible for analgesia. Fentanyl is a 4-anilidopiperidine compound. Like other opiates, this synthetic form exerts its effect by acting as a high-affinity agonist on selective Mu-opioid receptors in the brain. Also, it can exercise its effects on delta and kappa receptors to a lesser degree. The activation of Mu-opioid receptors causes analgesia and stimulating areas of the brain responsible for addictive potential. [4] Fentanyl can be detected in serum after about 1 to 2 hours after first administration but does not reach the therapeutic index until approximately 12 to 16 hours due to the need for fentanyl to saturate the epidermis before more efficient absorption. [5] Matrix patches are designed to deliver fentanyl at a constant rate and are available in various doses: 12, 25, 50, 75, and 100 mcg/hour, requiring replacement every 72 hours.

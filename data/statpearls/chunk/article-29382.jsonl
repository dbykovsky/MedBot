The spleen is one of the most commonly injured organs in blunt abdominal trauma. While it sometimes suffers injury in penetrating trauma, this is less common. Like with other traumatic injuries, the primary focus taking care of a trauma patient is resuscitation and rapid detection of serious injuries following the advanced trauma life support (ATLS) protocol. After performing a thorough physical exam and fluid resuscitation, a FAST exam is typically performed early in the evaluation of a trauma patient, sometimes as a part of the physical exam. Because the FAST exam can sometimes miss intraparenchymal injuries, a high degree of suspicion is necessary. The rest of the workup largely depends on hemodynamic stability. If the patient is hemodynamically stable, regardless of FAST exam results, the patient should undergo imaging using a CT scan. Active extravasation and blush of contrast are indicative of active bleeding. If the patient is hemodynamically unstable with a positive FAST exam, the patient can undergo exploratory laparotomy without further workup."}

It is expected that the incidence of metabolic syndrome will increase up to 53% in 2035. Other factors leading to metabolic syndrome include nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated (PPAR) modulation, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, high blood pressure, and certain proinflammatory states. Higher body fat mass also results in increased adipocyte size of subcutaneous and omentum fat. Hyperplasia occurs predominantly in subcutaneous fats, whereas hypertrophy is found in both mental and subcutaneous fat tissue. Eventually, fat accumulation progressively increased in the subcutaneous compartment as compared to visceral fat tissue.

{"id": "article-37693_3", "title": "Ergotamine/Caffeine  -- Mechanism of Action", "content": "Although the cause of migraine headaches is not entirely understood, the thinking is that arteriolar vasodilation and inflammation of the trigeminal nerve due to the release of local vasoactive peptides, such as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and calcitonin gene-related protein (CGRP) plays a role. CGRP is a neuropeptide that can be found in the central and peripheral nervous systems and has pain-signaling and vasodilator functions. Patients with migraines have elevated levels of circulating CGRP, and migraine medications, such as the ergot alkaloids, are associated with lowering these CGRP levels. [2] [4] Ergotamine has a complex mechanism of action that involves a variety of receptors, including 5-HT-1B/1D, dopamine, and alpha-adrenoreceptors. By activating 5HT-1B and 5HT-1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels, ergotamine induces vasoconstriction and relief of migraine headaches. Ergotamine also inhibits norepinephrine uptake and stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors at therapeutic doses, leading to prolonged vasoconstriction. Blood flow to the extremities thus becomes reduced. [5]", "contents": "Ergotamine/Caffeine  -- Mechanism of Action.

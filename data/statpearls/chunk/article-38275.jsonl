It helps contract myoepithelial cells around the alveoli,\u00a0causing the ejection of the breast's already-made milk. [12] [13] The ducts beneath the areola fill with milk and become wider during a feed when the oxytocin reflex is active. Oxytocin is produced more quickly than prolactin.

However, a few weeks later, the prolactin levels and quantity of milk produced are not tightly associated. But milk secretion stops if the mother stops breastfeeding. When breastfeeding is stopped,\u00a0the feedback inhibitor\u00a0of lactation (FIL) collects and destroys the cells from secreting more milk. When breast milk is removed during feeding or by the expression, FIL is also removed, resuming milk production.

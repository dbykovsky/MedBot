Strategies to increase awareness and early detection of HH include educating healthcare professionals, particularly primary care providers, to recognize the signs, symptoms, and characteristic laboratory findings of HH. Promoting genetic testing for probands and close family members is imperative for promptly initiating treatment to improve morbidity rates. Plans for monitoring disease progression require collaboration among healthcare professionals across multiple disciplines, including gastroenterology, cardiology, rheumatology, and endocrinology. Patient education must include information on the potential complications of iron overload, the benefits of therapeutic phlebotomy, and the significance of regular monitoring.", "contents": "Laboratory Evaluation of Hereditary Hemochromatosis -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

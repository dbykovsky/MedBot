However, to ensure the patient's safety, the practice of anesthesia is best done with an interprofessional team that also includes anesthesia nurses, recovery room nurses, and anesthesia assistants. Since there is no antidote to an anesthetic gas, the patient requires close monitoring during anesthesia. A dedicated nurse should monitor the vital signs continuously during induction and maintenance to ensure that the patient is not only sedated but has no pain.

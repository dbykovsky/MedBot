The variable clinical presentation of facial paralysis is a result of the complex anatomy of the facial nerve and its behavior when injured. The extent of flaccid paralysis in the acute posttraumatic period is dependent upon the severity of the injury and its location. Similarly, the occurrence and degree of synkinesis also depend on the degree and site of injury. The severity of motor nerve injury is commonly described using two similar scales, described by Sunderland and Seddon, that relate the degree of dysfunction to the microanatomy of the injury (see table).

If the proximal stump is not apparent, it can be located via dissection of the facial nerve distally from the main trunk. The main trunk of the facial nerve may be identified by tracing the tragal pointer\u00a0or deep aspect of the anterior surface of the tragal cartilage and the tympanomastoid suture line. The main trunk of the facial nerve is typically located under a small vein, deep to a fat pad, roughly 1 cm deep, and 1 cm inferior to the tragal pointer, within about 3 mm of the medial end of the tympanomastoid suture line. [35] Between where the facial nerve exits the stylomastoid foramen and where it branches at the pes anserinus within the parotid gland, the main trunk is approximately 2.5 mm in diameter and 14 mm long. [36] In some cases, the facial nerve may be approached directly via a facial laceration; the exploration is often performed via a modified Blair or parotidectomy-type incision."}

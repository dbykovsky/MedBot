[1] However, it is common to confuse occipital neuralgia with other diseases unless physicians notice other distinguishing factors. For instance, physicians must distinguish occipital neuralgia from infections, tumors, and congenital abnormalities, such as Arnold-Chiari malformation. They may confuse occipital neuralgia with migraines, cluster headaches, tension headaches, or hemicranial continua.

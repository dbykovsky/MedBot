After identifying a joint injury, it is imperative to promptly splint the joint and maintain proper alignment through the transport process. Joint injuries are difficult to manage, compared to other musculoskeletal injuries, given the complexities that can arise. In the prehospital setting, it can be difficult to distinguish between an isolated joint dislocation versus a joint injury with complications. Complications may include an associated fracture, injured blood vessel, or nerve injury. To provide safe management and avoid complications, it is important to treat all joint injuries in a stepwise fashion."}
{"id": "article-31743_33", "title": "Joint Immobilization -- Clinical Significance", "content": "For stable injuries, it is important to splint the joint in the position found and avoid complications from further manipulation. In instances where the patient position does not allow for safe transport or when there is a concern for distal neurovascular compromise, subtle joint manipulation may be indicated. When considering this intervention, it is important to understand the goal of treatment. When manipulating a joint injury, the goal is not to reduce the joint but rather to return distal neurovascular function and place the extremity in the closest anatomically neutral position. [7] Once the joint positioning is optimized, the patient will not only be more comfortable, but they will also be at less risk of suffering further soft tissue and neurovascular injury. Once the joint is aligned, a proper splint can be sized and placed to maintain the joint in the appropriate position for safe transport. With immobilization of lower extremity injuries, hips are to be splinted straight, knees are maintained in 10-degrees of flexion, and ankles are to be dorsiflexed and held at 90 degrees. With upper extremity immobilization, shoulders should be directed parallel to the chest, elbows are to be held in 90 degrees of flexion, wrists should be placed in a neutral position, and the fingers should be flexed.

Analgesic medication is an important starting point when dealing with these patients and should not be withheld if there is a suspected joint injury; however, the most effective pain management in joint injuries is provided with immobilization. When a proper splint is applied to the injured joint, the underlying cause of the pain can be treated rather than treating the symptoms alone. This is done by limiting motion, which prevents further movement into the joint barrier and the severe pain that follows.

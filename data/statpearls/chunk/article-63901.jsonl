To appreciate the Why of HFS, consider some truths about traditional clinical education and how HFS alleviates some of the burden associated with the apprentice model of healthcare education. Learning in the conventional clinical setting cannot be student-focused or manipulated, as the needs and safety of the patient must always take precedence. It is impossible to provide standardized experiences for all learners. Access to clinical sites can be challenging to secure and schedule. [21] Patient safety standards and safe work directives reduce the number of training hours, thereby decreasing the time for learning and exposure to various clinical situations. [9]"}

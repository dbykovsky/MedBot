{"id": "article-29174_5", "title": "Sea Snake Toxicity -- Pathophysiology", "content": "Sea snake venom contains a potent neurotoxin with low LD50 levels. Several enzymes are present in sea snake venom, including acetylcholinesterase, hyaluronidase, leucine aminopeptidase, 5'- nucleotidase, phosphomonoesterase, phosphodiesterase, and phospholipase A. Sea snake venom acts at both presynaptic and postsynaptic sites. The presynaptic toxin is thought to be due to phospholipase A. This toxin initially causes the release of acetylcholine but, ultimately, the inhibition of\u00a0acetylcholine\u00a0release. The postsynaptic neurotoxin is a small protein between 6,000 and 8,000 daltons. This neurotoxin binds nearly irreversibly to the postsynaptic membrane at acetylcholine receptor sites. The net effect of both the presynaptic and postsynaptic toxin is the inhibition of neural impulses which can lead to skeletal muscle paralysis, including paralysis of the respiratory muscles and diaphragm. Other toxins, such as phospholipase A, can cause myonecrosis with resultant muscle breakdown, myoglobinuria, and elevated creatinine and creatine kinase levels.

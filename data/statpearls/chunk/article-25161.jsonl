The patients should be mindful of the supplements they are taking and their ingredients. Frequently, patients are unknowingly taking calcium through multiple sources. The recommended dose and potentially harmful doses, tailored according to the patient\u2019s requirements, need to be formally discussed with the patient. This is especially important for patients with chronic renal disease because the chances of developing potentially lethal hypercalcemia and metabolic alkalosis are higher in these patients. Patients who develop hypercalcemia also need to be educated about the reversibility of the syndrome with the discontinuation of the offending agent."}

Clinicians should keep milk-alkali syndrome high on the differential when dealing with a patient presenting with hypercalcemia. Though generally asymptomatic and discovered incidentally, it can rapidly lead to the development of life-threatening hypercalcemia and alkalosis and may progress to renal failure if left untreated. Clinicians need to be well-versed in the causes, pathophysiology, complications, and management of hypercalcemia and alkalosis resulting from this disorder. Being a reversible condition, early management can prove to be life-saving.", "contents": "Milk-Alkali Syndrome -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

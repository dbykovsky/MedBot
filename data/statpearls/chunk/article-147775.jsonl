[110] This triangle is derived from two psychoanalytic theories: transactional psychoanalysis, developed by Eric Berne in the 1950s, and thematic analysis, developed by Stephen Karpman in the 1960s. The triangle describes a complex transactional interaction between a persecutor, victim, and rescuer. In this case, the APP is the persecutor, the patient the victim, and the pharmacist the rescuer. To break this triangle, individuals within the triangle will need to develop self-awareness of their respective position and understand how unexplored transference/countertransference dynamics can lead to the perpetuation of destructive interpersonal dynamics."}

Earlier intervention at several points could have prevented this outcome. Attention to transference may have led to the APP focusing first on therapeutic alliance and addressing the transference before initiating medication. The pharmacist's recognition of their countertransference may have led to recognizing a split sooner, and in turn, the pharmacist may have reached out to the APP to collaborate openly. The pharmacist could then empathically facilitate a discussion between the APP and the patient. Pharmacists are essential intermediaries between patients and providers.

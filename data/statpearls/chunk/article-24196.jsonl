This was done by Henri Leriche, a French surgeon, and physiologist, now known as the father of LS. The extent and localization of atherosclerotic occlusions relative to these arteries determine the classification of the disease. AIOD is classified as Type I (confined to the distal abdominal aorta and common iliac arteries), Type II (predominately distal abdominal aorta with disease extension into common iliac and external iliac arteries), and Type III (affecting the aortoiliac segment and femoropopliteal vessels). [2] AIOD, when symptomatic, classically presents with a triad of claudication, impotence, and absence of femoral pulses. Claudication refers to cramping leg pain that is reproducible by exercise. This article will cover the etiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, evaluation, management options, differential diagnosis, prognosis, possible complications, and clinical pearls of LS in detail.", "contents": "Leriche Syndrome -- Introduction.

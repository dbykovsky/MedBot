The prognosis of CGD is improving with advancements in treatment. Patients can prevent infection with good skin hygiene, antifungals, and antibiotics. Autosomal recessive forms of CGD have a better prognosis compared to X-linked CGD. On average, CGD patients survive at least 40 years, especially with long-term prophylactic antimicrobials. Often a severe fungal or bacterial infection can be fatal. Aspergillus is the most common fungal respiratory infection\u00a0and is the most common cause of death in CGD. Mortality and morbidity will continue to decrease as advances are made in prophylactic methods, HSCT,\u00a0and other immunomodulatory therapy."}

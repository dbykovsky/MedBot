It also is one of the circumventricular organs, which can detect circulating chemical messengers in the blood and incorporate neural inputs in the brainstem.

The absence of tight junctions between endothelial cells and its composition of sinusoidal fenestrated capillaries aids in physiologic signaling with its neurons, playing a role in the cardiovascular system and those that regulate feeding and metabolism. It mediates the effect of angiotensin II, which increases the arterial blood pressure without significantly impacting the heart rate. Additionally, neurons in the area postrema can use stretch receptors in the stomach to integrate mechanical information; this aids in somatic growth and in stimulating appetite. [1] These functions are immature are birth and develop over time. A less studied role includes the impact on the respiratory drive: when stimulated, the neurons increase respiratory drive, and when damaged, they contribute to the decrease in respiratory rate.

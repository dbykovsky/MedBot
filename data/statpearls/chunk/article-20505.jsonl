It can be difficult in obese patients to recognize distension of the abdomen from gastric expansion, and initial end-tidal CO2 monitors may show a color change or some quantitative end-tidal CO2. Auscultation of breath sounds is notoriously ineffective in definitively determining esophageal intubation due to the proximity of the stomach to the diaphragm. The obvious sign then becomes desaturation despite the external appearance of adequate ventilation. In this case, the endotracheal tube should be removed immediately, and mask ventilation resumed to provide oxygenation.

Usually, the right mainstem bronchus branches at a more acute angle than the left main stem bronchus thus leading to right mainstem bronchial intubation.

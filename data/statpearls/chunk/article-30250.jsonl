The Norwegian physician, Hjalmar Schiotz, invented the first clinically useful indentation tonometer in 1905. [59] This portable tonometer (See Schiotz images) employs a rarely used, older technique. It consists of a weighted plunger attached to a footplate positioned on the cornea. Weights are stacked onto the probe to cause depression of the cornea. The number of weights stacked onto the probe correlates to a calibrated intraocular pressure using a conversion chart provided with the device. [7] The patient must be supine during measurement, and a topical corneal anesthetic is required. [19] This tonometer is relatively inexpensive and easy to use and is sometimes still used in children under general anesthesia and developing countries.

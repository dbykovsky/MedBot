CMS is preparing to release a new 13th SOW for the contract period spanning 2024\u00a0to 2029. Visions for the future of the QIO program include alignment with other HHS and CMS strategic plans, evidence-based targeted quality improvement, advancement from education to implementation of quality improvement to drive cultural change, identifying trends between BFCC-QIO and QIN-QIO activities, and improvements in IT systems, data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to position the QIO program as the nation\u2019s resource for quality improvement (CMS: Quality Conference 2023). QIO-led initiatives can only be implemented if every member of the healthcare team plays an active role in appropriately caring for their patients and is empowered to contribute to quality improvement."}

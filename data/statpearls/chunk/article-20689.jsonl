Patients and parents should be aware of the generally positive outcomes after surgery. If surgery is still refused, appropriate outpatient cardiology follow-up is necessary to decrease the chance of decreased ventricular output, coronary ischemia, arrhythmias, and possible sudden cardiac death.", "contents": "Double-Chambered Right Ventricle -- Deterrence and Patient Education. If possible, it is pivotal to discuss early correction after diagnosis with patients and parents to avoid the progressive development of right ventricular intracavitary obstruction by anomalous muscle bundles, which tend to worsen over time. Patients and parents should be aware of the generally positive outcomes after surgery. If surgery is still refused, appropriate outpatient cardiology follow-up is necessary to decrease the chance of decreased ventricular output, coronary ischemia, arrhythmias, and possible sudden cardiac death."}
{"id": "article-20689_27", "title": "Double-Chambered Right Ventricle -- Pearls and Other Issues", "content": "Key facts to consider when managing\u00a0DCRV include the following: DCRV is a rare condition where the right ventricle separates into\u00a02 compartments: a proximal, high-pressure compartment and a distal, low-pressure compartment. Type 1 has anomalous muscle bundles dividing the right ventricle and type 2 involves parietal and septal muscle hypertrophy. This condition is most often diagnosed in children but can present in adults. If present, other structural cardiac abnormalities must be considered. Membranous ventricular septal defect is the most common abnormality present in over 75% of cases. Due to the progressive nature of the right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, surgery is sometimes recommended even in asymptomatic cases. Surgery is recommended if the pressure gradient between the proximal and distal sections of the right ventricular outflow tract is higher than 40 mm Hg. The most common clinical symptoms are dyspnea, exertional fatigue, presyncope, and palpitations.", "contents": "Double-Chambered Right Ventricle -- Pearls and Other Issues.

Part of having a successful surgical outcome involves\u00a0the coordination of patient care between the cardiology, intensive care unit, and surgical teams. Cardiology follow-up is required to assess cardiac function, detect the presence of any residual lesions, measure exercise capacity, assess any existing arrhythmias, and evaluate the patient's quality of life. Nursing plays a critical role in helping manage this condition by preparing the patient for surgery, monitoring vital parameters, assisting during surgery, administering postoperative care, and reporting to the surgical team and the cardiologists involved.", "contents": "Double-Chambered Right Ventricle -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

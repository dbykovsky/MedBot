This was secondary to, again, DECREASE III and IV trials, reporting an exaggerated benefit of statin therapy and combined beta-blocker/statin therapy, respectively. [30] [31] Unfortunately, the results of most of the DECREASE trials were found to be fictitiously reported, and guidelines based on their findings were\u00a0retracted. [32] Regardless, other trials have shown benefit in lowering the risk of major cardiac complications in the perioperative vascular surgery and with patients with known CAD in the perioperative setting, although not as high as the DECREASE III and IV trials. [33] [34] [33] Guideline therapy suggests continuing statin on patients already on statins; initiation of statin is reasonable in patients undergoing vascular disease. [16]"}

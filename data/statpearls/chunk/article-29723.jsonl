Mutations that affect the function of this enzyme have been shown to cause chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), a rare disease (1\u00a0in 200,000 live births) that presents with multiple bacterial and fungal infections starting in infancy or early childhood. [29] This disease can present due to mutations in five different subunits of the NADPH oxidase enzyme, the most common being a mutation in the CYBB gene, with X-linked recessive inheritance. [29] Bacterial infections mainly result from Staphyloccocus aureus, Burkholderia cepacia, Nocardia, Serratia marcescens, and Salmonella , all of which are catalase-positive organisms. These patients can also develop local or systemic disease after the application of the BCG vaccine. [29] Fungal infections normally result from Aspergillus species. Patients can develop infections in the lungs, lymph nodes, skin and soft tissues, liver, bones, and gastrointestinal tract. [29]", "contents": "Biochemistry, Superoxides -- Clinical Significance.

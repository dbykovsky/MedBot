Drug monitoring is suggested if the patient's creatinine clearance\u00a0is \u226450 mL/min or the given pathogen's minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is \u22654 mg/L. If treating outside of these parameters, then dose\u00a0adjustment is indicated. [34] [35] [36] PT/INR should be monitored as cefepime can elevate INR in patients with renal dysfunction. [37] [38]"}

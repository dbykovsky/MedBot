This results in the least neck movement and is especially useful in a patient with an unstable cervical spine injury. In reviewing the literature, the term video laryngoscopy is used generically without always delineating which type. [27] It is important to know the type that is being reviewed or compared.\u00a0There can, however, rarely be situations where video laryngoscopy may be difficult or fail. \u00a0It is important to consider what some of those predictors are so contingency plans can be made."}

Syringomas: Characterized by multiple 2 to 4 mm skin-colored, brown, or pink papules, typically found on periorbital skin but may also occur in intertriginous areas or other regions. Distinguishing them from Fox-Fordyce disease may require a biopsy. Histologically, syringomas exhibit small collections of epithelial cells with central ducts in the superficial dermis. [40] [41] Acanthosis nigricans: Characterized by hyperpigmented velvety plaques that may appear papular, typically found in intertriginous sites or skin folds such as the axillae or posterior neck. Graham-Little-Piccardi-Lasseur syndrome: Defined by lichen planopilaris and nonscarring alopecia affecting other body areas, particularly the axillae."}

[44] This idea stems from established histopathological evidence demonstrating the efficacy of microneedle radiofrequency in treating axillary hyperhidrosis. [45] Additionally, reports indicate that microneedling promotes the migration and proliferation of epidermal and dermal cells, including keratinocytes and fibroblasts, which release various growth factors.

Presents with pruritic papular eruptions in apocrine gland-rich areas like the axillae, areolae, and anogenital region. The clinical manifestations include dome-shaped papules often distributed linearly around areas rich in apocrine glands. Severe cases may lead to lichenification, hyperpigmentation, and localized anhidrosis. Diagnosis is mainly clinical, but additional evaluation methods such as dermoscopy and histopathology can provide supportive evidence. Management involves symptomatic relief, typically with topical corticosteroids, clindamycin, retinoids, or other interventions to reduce inflammation and sweating. Severe or refractory cases may require procedures like surgical excision or laser therapy.", "contents": "Fox-Fordyce Disease (Apocrine Miliaria) -- Pearls and Other Issues.

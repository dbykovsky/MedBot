Invasion causes complications such as cavernous sinus thrombosis and central nervous system infections with mortality of around 50%; therefore, urgent treatment is necessary. Complications can occur fast, and recurrence of disease is not unusual, and repeated debridements are often required. Survivers might have facial deformities, nerve damage, and chronic pain.

One of the significant complications of invasive fungal sinusitis is the ability to spread to the cavernous sinuses and cause systemic manifestations with potentially fatal complications. As such, clinicians must recognize presentations suspicious for invasive fungal sinusitis and treat them as rapidly as possible; this is one of the incentives behind the discovery of diagnostic modalities that allow for quick recognition and treatment of fungal sinusitis.

Infrequently, a molar pregnancy can coexist with a normal pregnancy. The diagnosis is usually made by ultrasound. Despite the high risk of spontaneous abortion, 40% to 60% of cases result in live births. The risk of GTN in a coexisting molar and normal pregnancy is 27% to 46%; in a singleton molar pregnancy, the risk is 15% to 20%. Pregnancy can proceed if there are no complications, negative genetic studies, and normal ultrasound findings. [27]"}

Signs and symptoms differ according to the disease's location. For example, patients with brain metastases may present with headaches, seizures, or hemiparesis. In contrast, patients with lung metastasis can present with shortness of breath, hemoptysis, or pleuritic chest pain. Since menstrual irregularity is not always present, the diagnosis can be missed. Recommended imaging studies are whole-body CT scans, MRI of the brain and pelvis, and Doppler ultrasonography. If the brain scan is negative, a lumbar puncture should be done to assess the ratio of cerebrospinal fluid to serum hCG. [6]"}

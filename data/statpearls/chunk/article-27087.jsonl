[5] This would also be the step to determine what type of cell and bio-incubator should be used to produce the product. Chemical optimization for small molecules involves changing the chemical structure to enhance the therapeutic effect while minimizing the interaction of the drug with CYP450s and transporter protein and HERG or sodium channels involved in cardiac conduction. At this stage, screening for interactions across a large panel of receptors and transporters takes place and when patents get submitted.

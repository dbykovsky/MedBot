The American Dental Association does not routinely recommend antimicrobial prophylaxis in patients with implanted prosthetic joints before dental procedures. [39] The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons also does not recommend antimicrobial prophylaxis in this population, citing that there has not been any study that demonstrates an association between bacteremia induced by dental procedures and prosthetic joint infection. To date, no study has shown that antimicrobial prophylaxis decreased the rate of prosthetic joint infection."}

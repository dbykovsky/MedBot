A clavus results from repeated friction, pressure, or trauma to a specific area of the foot. A callus is another hyperkeratotic skin lesion that is similar to a clavus. It is an area of thickened epidermis with less defined borders and is also the result of repeated mechanical stress. Additionally, calluses lack the painful central core seen with clavi.

Other factors such as physical activity, ill-fitting footwear, and foot deformities causing bony prominences contribute to the development of clavi.

The most common location is the foot, including the dorsolateral aspect of the fifth interphalangeal joint, between the toes, and on the sole. The foot is extremely susceptible to the development of clavi due to the amount of repeated mechanical stress introduced to the area daily. [1] [2]", "contents": "Clavus (Archived) -- Etiology.

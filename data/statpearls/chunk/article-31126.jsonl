When performing vertebroplasty, it is important to rule out tenderness in the sacroiliac and facet joints. [4] In cases of multiple compression fractures, the severity of the fractures can be determined by examining marrow edema in T1 and short-tau inversion recovery MRI sequences, focal intense uptake in bone scans, and end plate fracture line alongside paravertebral soft tissue density in CT images. [4] Vertebroplasty involves passing through the neural arch beyond the spinal canal into the vertebral body, so it must be extremely reliable, precise, accurate, and safe. [4] A thorough understanding of the fluoroscopic anatomy of the vertebral column is crucial. Obtaining true lateral projections, identifying the medial cortex of the pedicle on the anteroposterior views, and obtaining biplanar fluoroscopic images during needle placement are important. PVP can be performed with the patient under local or conscious sedation, but PKP requires general anesthesia. The salient steps involved in the procedure include:"}

Similarly, low-quality evidence indicates a small clinical benefit of PKP compared to nonsurgical management, PVP, vertebral body stenting, or KIVA. [3] These findings highlight the need for careful consideration of study design, patient characteristics, and procedural details when interpreting the evidence on interventions for VCFs."}

The estimated 3-year survival rates were approximately 40% for nonsurgical management, 50% for PVP, and 60% for PKP. [5] Similarly, a study conducted with German health insurance data revealed that cohorts undergoing VA were 43% less likely to die compared to those opting for nonsurgical management within 5 years.

Patients should be educated about the rarity of Morvan syndrome, the conditions it mimics or with which it can be confused, and its association with occult malignancies. Patients should also be informed that MoS is often responsive to treatment, and full recovery occurs in some patients. MoS patients may need considerable support from unpaid caregivers.

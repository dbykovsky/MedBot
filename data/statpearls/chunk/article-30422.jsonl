[42] They found the average length of stay to be seven days, with 35/126 (28%) experiencing at least one adverse event.\u00a0Two patients had prolonged hospital stay longer than 30 days, 12 had pneumonia,\u00a0three had sepsis,\u00a0six developed wound infections,\u00a0three developed wound dehiscence, five required unplanned reintubation, and 16 had an unplanned reoperation. The 30-day unplanned readmission rate was 16% (20/126). The mortality rate was 0%.

Early evaluation by speech therapy is recommended to initiate proper swallowing exercises and voice control.

Although their precise role in prostate cancer screening is still being determined, it is suggested that risk-stratification bioassays are most helpful in patients with persistently elevated PSA levels who are llow-riskor borderline/equivocal cases where the result will be used, if negative, to help make a clinical decision not to pursue further prostate cancer diagnostic testing or screening procedures immediately. [1] [2] They may also have a role in patients in patients on active surveillance and those with a high-grade PIN or atypical small acinar proliferation (ASAP), which are considered pre-malignant.

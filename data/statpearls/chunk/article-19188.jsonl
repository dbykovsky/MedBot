Gait training has been documented as the most effective way to improve gait speed (compared to other methods, including strength, velocity, and biofeedback). This training should be used appropriately, as gait speed is a significant indicator of overall quality of life and functional mobility. [17] Passive stretching has historically been utilized to reduce spasticity (with various forms of stretching utilized); however, research results have displayed limited data to support passive stretching for a range of motion or functional benefits. According to the literature, prolonged stretches are of greater benefit, but continued research is needed to determine the impact of stretching.

Common challenges regarding complications from prolonged ECMO use include bleeding and thrombosis. Thrombosis occurs due to the interaction between components of the ECMO system and blood. To circumvent thrombosis formation, strict adherence to anticoagulation\u00a0monitoring is vital. Understanding the pathophysiology of thrombosis formation, the mechanism of action of common anticoagulants, and the monitoring of anticoagulation parameters will decrease thrombosis formation incidence."}

Pulmonary or cardiopulmonary support may be provided dependent on the patient\u2019s needs. ECMO configurations may also be interchanged dependent on patient needs. The initiation of ECMO-dependent life support requires the cooperation of several different clinical providers. A cardiothoracic surgeon is commonly involved in the initiation of ECMO and the placement of cannulas. Following the start of ECMO, a perfusionist must be available bedside around the clock to monitor for acute changes in the functioning of the circuit. Besides, the effect of heparin must be monitored hourly and adjusted as needed. Hourly arterial blood gas measurements are recorded as well. Intensive care practitioners such as physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners provide oversight of the patient's clinical course and alert the cardiothoracic surgeon to any issues that may arise.", "contents": "Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Anticoagulation -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

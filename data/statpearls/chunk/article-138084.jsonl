Local containment is the best defense against the worldwide spread. Historically, the mpox virus has a limited ability to spread between humans. Nonetheless, the waning population of people vaccinated against smallpox paves the way for an increased prevalence of human mpox, increasing viral mutation opportunities. Therefore, improving patient recognition of this disease, reporting fidelity, and access to diagnostic capabilities are critical actions for collecting the data necessary to gain a deeper understanding of and strengthen defense against mpox.

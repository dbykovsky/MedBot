Oral Cladribine in Early Multiple Sclerosis (ORACLE MS) was another multi-center, double-blind, randomized, phase\u00a0III\u00a0study of oral cladribine which showed a\u00a0significant risk reduction compared to placebo for time to conversion to clinically definite MS, as measured by magnetic resonance\u00a0imaging (hazard ratio [HR] for 5.25 mg/kg = 0.38, 95% CI 0.25 - 0.58, p<0.0001; HR for 3.5 mg/kg = 0.33, 95% CI 0.21 - 0.51, p<0.0001), for adults who had experienced a first clinically-isolated demyelinating syndrome (CIS). [22] Investigators stopped the ORACLE MS trial early because 5% of patients in the\u00a0high-dose cladribine group and\u00a02% in the\u00a0low-dose cladribine group developed severe\u00a0lymphopenia. A follow-up reanalysis of the ORACLE MS data using modern MS diagnostic criteria was published in 2017 and upheld cladribine\u2019s efficacy in early MS. Stuve and colleagues demonstrated that cladribine-induced lymphopenia is reversible and that the T-cell and B-cell populations can reconstitute. [16] More recently, a phase II, multi-center, randomized study of add-on cladribine with interferon-beta (the ONWARD trial) found that 124 participants who were randomly assigned to receive cladribine 3.5 mg/kg plus IFN-\u00df (N=124) were 63% less likely to have an MS relapse compared with participants assigned to the placebo plus IFN-\u00df group ( p < 0.001). Cladribine also reduced the\u00a0mean number of new T1 and T2 MRI lesions in the combined treatment arm\u00a0compared to\u00a0placebo plus IFN-\u00df (Level I). [23] [24]"}

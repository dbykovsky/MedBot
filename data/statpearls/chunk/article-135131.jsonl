For in vitro laboratory identification, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is a strict aerobe that is usually oxidase negative, though it was shown that up to 20% could show positive oxidase activity. [17] [63] It is also catalase-positive, DNase-positive, lysine decarboxylase positive, indole negative, HS negative, and urease negative. [4] [9] It is known to produce acid from maltose, hence the name maltophilia, but not always from glucose.\u00a0Many commercial systems are available for identification but are not very accurate. [2] Therefore, it has been misdiagnosed as Burkholderia cepacia -complex, Achromobacter xylosoxidans , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and Bordetella bronchiseptica an identification challenge."}

Inadequate supplies of penicillin are also an issue in many locations. For example, the manufacturer has discontinued procaine penicillin production in the US. In such situations, pregnant women who test positive for syphilis should be given the top priority for any available supplies. Ceftriaxone may be substituted at 50 mg/kg to 75 mg/kg body weight\u00a0intravenously daily for 10 days in the neonate, but ceftriaxone is not considered equivalent to penicillin and requires careful follow-up clinical evaluations and serological testing.

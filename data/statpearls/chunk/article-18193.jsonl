{"id": "article-18193_3", "title": "Bekhterev-Jacobsohn Reflex -- Anatomy and Physiology", "content": "The Bekhterev-Jacobsohn reflex is elicited by stroking the distal radius of the upper arm. The brachioradialis tendon is located in this area near the radial styloid process. The brachioradialis reflex with hyperreflexia is most likely a part of what is seen with the Bekhterev-Jacobsohn\u00a0reflex. Therefore, the brachioradialis reflex will be discussed. The brachioradialis reflex is a deep tendon reflex with the C5-C6 nerve roots and the radial nerve involved in its circuitry. [3] The reflex happens by the tap stretching the tendon, which stimulates receptors in the muscle group. [4] These stimulated receptors then initiate the reflex arc that generates a message loop from the muscle to the spinal cord and back down to the muscle, which causes the muscle to twitch. [5] The reflex arc generates a sensory impulse to the spinal cord through the sensory or afferent nerve pathway that synapses at the spinal cord and sends an impulse back via the motor or efferent nerve pathway, which contracts the muscle. [6] In diseases causing hyperreflexia, there is disruption of impulses between the cerebral cortex and spinal cord that does not allow the cortex to send inhibitory impulses to the spinal cord; therefore, a crossing of reflexes and hyperreflexia are produced. [5] [7] Hyperreflexia of the brachioradialis includes supination of the wrist (normal reflex) along with finger flexion (abnormal), which is also seen as part of the Bekhterev-Jacobsohn reflex.", "contents": "Bekhterev-Jacobsohn Reflex -- Anatomy and Physiology.

The natural history of NH is different from that of hypertension in older children. The median duration of therapy with antihypertensive drugs in infants in NICU\u00a0 was reported to be ten days in a study that included 700 infants. Infants suffering from hypertension due to BPD are usually found to have their BP normalized on follow-up examinations.

Early, aggressive and effective treatment should be provided in such conditions. Common complications of longstanding and severe hypertension are hypertensive nephropathy with variable renal dysfunction and hypertensive cardiomyopathy with left ventricular hypertrophy, dilation, and/or dysfunction. The long term adverse effects and sequelae of untreated as compared to treated hypertension in infants are unknown. Recent epidemiological evidence suggests that childhood hypertension is associated with a higher risk for adulthood hypertension.", "contents": "Neonatal Hypertension -- Complications.

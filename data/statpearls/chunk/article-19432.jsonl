Assessment of the severity of the disease helps to stratify the patients into different treatment groups. The CURB65 scoring is a suitable tool to use in all cases of CAP as it takes clinical history, examination findings, and laboratory value into account and can be used in primary healthcare settings as well. It includes the following elements for assessment: Confusion with new-onset (Abbreviated mental score: < 9 or, orientation to time, place, person: < 3) Blood Urea Nitrogen: > 19 mg/dL Respiratory Rate: 30/minute or higher Blood Pressure: < 90 mmHg (systolic) or <60 mmHg (diastolic) Age of 65 or more Each element carries one point. The patient can be managed according to the outcome score, which ranges from 0-5. Score 0-1: Outpatient treatment; may need further assessment Score 2: Consider hospitalization to monitor and start therapy Score 3-5: Hospitalization, possibly intensive care unit (ICU) admission, particularly for a score of 4 or 5 [25] [26]"}

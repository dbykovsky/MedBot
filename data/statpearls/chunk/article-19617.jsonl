The use of benzodiazepines, including\u00a0clonazepam,\u00a0has the potential for\u00a0misuse and addiction. Misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involves concomitant use of alcohol and illicit substances, including opioids. The continued use\u00a0of clonazepam\u00a0can\u00a0lead to physical dependence. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of\u00a0clonazepam\u00a0after continued use may precipitate life-threatening acute withdrawal. A risk\u00a0mitigation strategy involves a gradual\u00a0dose reduction\u00a0of clonazepam. [38]"}

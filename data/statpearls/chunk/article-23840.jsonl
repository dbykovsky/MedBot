These signs can include a lack of testicular development determined by testicular volume in men and a failure to start menstruation (amenorrhea) in women. Poorly defined secondary sexual characteristics can include a lack of pubic hair and underdeveloped mammary glands. Micropenis may also be present in a small portion of male cases, while cryptorchidism or undescended testicles may have been present at birth. These traits are related to low levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), which consequentially results in low testosterone in males and estrogen and progesterone in women.

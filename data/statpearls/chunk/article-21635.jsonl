Vitamin D toxicity, although rare, can occur in individuals taking large doses of vitamin D supplements with a heavy intake of fortified foods. Most symptoms of hypervitaminosis D stem from hypercalcemia caused by excessive calcium absorption in the duodenum and distal convoluted tubule.

The interprofessional team involves physicians, medical assistants, dieticians, pharmacists, and patients. For example, a pediatrician must recognize risk factors for vitamin D deficiency in a neonate, including being exclusively breastfed and having darker skin. Clinicians, who often spend the most time with patients, are in a position to recognize abnormal signs and symptoms in high-risk patients and report their findings to the physician. Their watchful eye is vital in catching alarming symptoms early, such as headaches and seizures caused by vitamin-A toxicity. Dieticians and nutritionists carry out primary and tertiary prevention of fat-soluble vitamin excess or deficiency and play an essential role in modulating a patient\u2019s diet and ensuring the meeting of their dietary needs.

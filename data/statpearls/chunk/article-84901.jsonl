[3] There are many reasons for rectal foreign body insertion including, sexual gratification, concealment, as may be the case in body packers, sexual assault, and, rarely, accidental causes, but the most common purpose is autoeroticism due to the increasing use of a different object for anal sex. [4] [5] The time of presentation varies; some people consult emergency services immediately because of their inability to remove the object. At the same time, other patients might take up to two weeks before the presentation due to embarrassment.

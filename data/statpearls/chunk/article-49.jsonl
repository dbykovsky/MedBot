Their responsibilities include obtaining informed consent, addressing patient concerns, and offering postprocedure guidance. Nurses are pivotal in educating patients about the procedure, providing preprocedural and postprocedural care, and monitoring patients for potential complications, ensuring patient safety and comfort. Pharmacists ensure the judicious use of medications for pain management and symptom relief. Effective interprofessional communication, encompassing concise information exchange and shared care protocols, is fundamental to harmonizing patient care.

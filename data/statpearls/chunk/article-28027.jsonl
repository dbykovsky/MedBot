However, about 20% of patients are estimated to survive without any treatment. The uncertainty regarding the progression of the disease and the severity of the symptoms, along with its poor prognosis, have a profound impact on the quality of life of both patients and their families. [65] Since 2010, IPF survival rates have shown improvement, which may be partly attributed to antifibrotic therapies and earlier diagnosis. [68]"}
{"id": "article-28027_54", "title": "Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis -- Prognosis", "content": "Although the actual survival range for individual patients varies considerably, up to 20% to 25% may live beyond 10 years after diagnosis. Despite this, most patients continue to experience dyspnea and limited exercise tolerance, leading to a poor quality of life. Deaths are most common in winter, even in the absence of lung infections. Many patients develop pulmonary hypertension, increasing their risk of pulmonary embolism and sudden cardiac death. The prognosis tends to be worse for those with severe changes noted on imaging findings and a lack of response to oxygen therapy. [69] [70]", "contents": "Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis -- Prognosis.

The fracture location is superior to the medial and lateral condyles and epicondyles. Supracondylar fractures of the distal humerus by the elbow joint can compromise nerve and vasculature depending on its displacement. Anterior displacement puts the median nerve and brachial artery at risk. Posterior displacement puts the radial artery at risk. Palpation of distal pulses and capillary refill should be part of the initial workup to survey for preserved blood supply. Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs are necessary for accurate diagnosis and treatment. Nondisplaced fractures are treated initially with a posterior splint and eventual casting. Displaced fractures are reduced, and pinned percutaneously. Malunion, compartment syndrome, and neurovascular complications are morbidities related to this fracture.

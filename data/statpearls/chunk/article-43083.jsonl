{"id": "article-43083_3", "title": "Clavulanic Acid -- Mechanism of Action", "content": "Clavulanic acid use is always in conjunction with amoxicillin in its salt form clavulanate potassium. Amoxicillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic that disrupts bacterial\u00a0cell wall synthesis. It binds to penicillin-binding proteins that are present on the inside of the bacterial cell wall, and this inhibits the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer in the cell wall. [3] This disruption in cell wall synthesis leads to cell lysis and bacterial death. Certain bacterial species produce the enzyme beta-lactamase, which can inactivate beta-lactam drugs by hydrolyzing the beta-lactam ring in the antibiotic compound, leading to drug resistance. Clavulanic acid is an inhibitor of beta-lactamase enzymes. Clavulanic acid contains a beta-lactam ring that binds to the beta-lactamase active site and inactivates the enzyme, thereby enhancing the antibacterial effect of beta-lactam antibiotics, such as amoxicillin. It is provided in a fixed dosage with amoxicillin. Clavulanic acid is classified as a suicide inhibitor of these beta-lactamases because it permanently inactivates the enzyme through chemical reactions at the active site. [1] Clavulanic acid alone has no know antibacterial effect and is always used in combination\u00a0with amoxicillin. [4]", "contents": "Clavulanic Acid -- Mechanism of Action.

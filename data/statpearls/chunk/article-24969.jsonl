PPSV is composed of 23 pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides, and it covers the broadest range of antigens out of all pneumococcal vaccines. Children less than two years old do not respond to this vaccination, though it is suitable only for patients\u00a0over two years of age. In the meta-analysis by Falkenhorst et al., PPSV23 efficacy against IPD caused by any serotype was reported to be 73% in a pooled analysis of all included clinical trials enrolling adults aged above 60 years living in industrialized countries. [23] PCV contains pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides linked to a carrier protein that allows the immune system of infants to produce antibodies. The recommendation is to use PCV in the children's routine immunizations. There are two types of PCV available with a different number of serotypes: PCV10 and PCV13. Lucero et al. conducted a meta-analysis of six randomized trials of different valencies of PCV. In children of less than two years of age, the efficacy of PCV for preventing vaccine-type IPD was 80%, and 58% for preventing IPD caused by all serotypes. [24] The CAPiTA trial assessed the efficacy of PCV13 with immunocompetent adults above 65 years of age enrolled. Results demonstrated about 75% efficacy against the vaccine-type invasive pneumococcal disease. [25]", "contents": "Streptococcal Meningitis -- Pearls and Other Issues -- Prevention. Among all streptococcal meningitides, only pneumococcal is a vaccine-preventable condition. Two types of vaccines exist against Streptococcus pneumoniae : older pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV) and newer pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV).

It may pose a diagnostic challenge, especially in infants, because these patients may exhibit non-specific signs. The most vital for a patient outcome is fast diagnosis and treatment. Doctors who work in primary care facilities should educate their patients about alarming symptoms of meningitis. While the pediatrician or internist is almost always involved in the care of patients with streptococcal meningitis, it is essential to cooperate with other specialists that include infectious disease experts or anesthesiologists if needed. The nurses are also vital members of the interprofessional group, as they will monitor the patient's vital signs. Laboratory professionals play an essential role in establishing the diagnosis of causative agents. A physiotherapist is also needed to reduce the neurological burden of streptococcal meningitis. A board-certified infectious disease pharmacist can review antibiotic choices with the clinician, using the latest antibiogram data.

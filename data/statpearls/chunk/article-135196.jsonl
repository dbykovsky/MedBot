There is no proven effective treatment modality, including systemic steroid, plasmapheresis, cyclosporin, Anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). [26] [43] All the reported clinical data regarding these medications are anecdotal and mainly based on observational studies. The rarity of TEN cases makes it extremely challenging to achieve high-standard randomized controlled clinical trials to test the efficacy of these treatment modalities. Systemic steroids are commonly used to halt the progression of TEN cases. However, some studies linked steroids to increase mortality incidence. Daily plasmapheresis for 3 days may enhance the elimination of the causative medication, its metabolites, and inflammatory mediators. However, there is no prospective randomized trial to support these findings. [44] TNF- alpha is overexpressed in the affected keratinocytes of skin lesions with a high concentration in skin blisters. Some studies report early resolution of skin lesions with TNF- alpha inhibitors. IVIG also showed encouraging results when started within the first 48\u00a0to 72 hours. [45]"}

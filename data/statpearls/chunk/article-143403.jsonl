On CT scans, SFTs exhibit notable vascularity, with approximately 65% of cases demonstrating avid contrast enhancement.

However, if fibrous elements are predominant, contrast enhancement also becomes marked in the delayed phases. [25] Interestingly, about 35% of cases show large collateral feeding vessels. Heterogeneity in enhancement is more common in aggressive SFTs compared to indolent ones, seen in 76.5% versus 40.0% of cases, respectively. SFTs typically demonstrate intermediate to high attenuation on unenhanced CT scans due to dense collagen fibers and a rich capillary network. Heterogeneous attenuation is observed in approximately 88% of cases.

Primary congenital megalocornea is characterized by enlarged corneas and deep anterior chambers without an increase in intraocular pressure. This rare genetic defect has been localized to the chordin-like 1 (CHRDL1) gene, which synthesizes the protein ventroptin, a BMP antagonist expressed in ocular structures early in development. This defect is located at the X chromosome, and the disease is generally inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern, though other inheritances have been reported Since megalocornea is associated with numerous other genetic syndromes and diseases, a thorough workup should be completed to assess for potential underlying causes. Patients may be asymptomatic or have astigmatism at birth. Presenile cataracts, ectopia lentis, and glaucoma may arise and are the most serious complications."}

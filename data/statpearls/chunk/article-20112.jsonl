In 2013, the American College of Rheumatology published the updated classification criteria for systemic sclerosis, offering improved sensitivity and specificity compared to the older 1980 criteria. [37] Although primarily designed for clinical study inclusion, these criteria can be applied cautiously in clinical settings. Utilizing a scoring system, a score of 9 or higher indicates classification as systemic sclerosis. Bilateral skin thickening proximal to metacarpophalangeal joints: 9 Skin thickening of fingers (counting only higher score) Between distal and proximal interphalangeal joints: 4 Puffy fingers: 2 Fingertip lesions\u00a0(counting only the higher score) Fingertip pitting scars: 3 Digital tip ulcers: 2 Telangiectasia: 2 Abnormal nailfold capillaries: 2 Raynaud phenomenon: 3 Lung disease (maximum score of 2) ILD: 2 PAH: 2 Positive systemic sclerosis-specific antibodies (anti-centromere,\u00a0anti\u2013Scl\u201370, and anti\u2013RNA polymerase III): 3"}

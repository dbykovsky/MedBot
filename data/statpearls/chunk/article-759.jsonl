{"id": "article-759_0", "title": "Physiology, Osmosis -- Introduction", "content": "In physiology, osmosis (Greek for push) is the net movement of water across a semipermeable membrane. [1] [2] Across this membrane, water will tend to move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. It is important to\u00a0emphasize that ideal osmosis requires only the movement of pure water across the membrane without any movement of solute particles across the semipermeable membrane. Osmosis can still occur with some permeability of solute particles, but the osmotic effect becomes reduced with greater solute permeability across the semipermeable membrane. It is also true that, at a specific moment in time, water molecules can move towards either the higher or lower concentration solutions, but the net movement of water will be towards the higher solute concentration.\u00a0The compartment with the highest solute and lowest water concentration has the greatest osmotic pressure.\u00a0Osmotic pressure can be calculated with the van 't Hoff equation, which states that osmotic pressure depends on the number of solute particles, temperature, and how well a solute particle can move across a membrane. Its measured osmolality can describe the osmotic pressure of a solution. The osmolality of a solution describes how many particles are dissolved in the solution. The reflection coefficient of a semipermeable membrane describes how well solutes permeate the membrane. This coefficient ranges from 0 to 1. A reflection coefficient of 1 means a solute is impermeable. A reflection coefficient of 0 means a solute can freely permeable, and the solute can no generate osmotic pressure across the membrane. [2] The compartment with the greatest osmotic pressure will pull water in and tend to equalize the solute concentration difference between the compartments.\u00a0The physical driving force of osmosis\u00a0is the increase in entropy generated by\u00a0the movement of free water molecules. There is also thought that the interaction of solute particles with membrane pores\u00a0is\u00a0involved in generating a negative pressure, which is the osmotic pressure driving the flow of water. [3] Reverse osmosis occurs when water is forced to flow in the opposite direction. In reverse osmosis, water flows into the compartment with lower osmotic pressure and higher water concentration. This flow is only possible with the application of an external force to the system. Reverse osmosis is commonly used to purify drinking water and requires the input of energy. [4] The concept of osmosis should not be confused with diffusion. Diffusion is the net movement of particles from an area of high to low concentration. One can think of osmosis as a specific type of diffusion.\u00a0Both osmosis and diffusion are passive processes and involve the movement of particles from an area of high to low concentration.

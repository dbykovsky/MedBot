Fluid overload is one, which causes a decrease in many of the electrolytes in plasma. This could lead to grossly depleted amounts of Na, K, Mg, or P. The after-effects of refeeding syndrome must also be evaluated. Independent cardiac arrhythmias, which are high risk from electrolyte imbalances, must also be ruled out, such as long QT syndrome.", "contents": "Refeeding Syndrome -- Differential Diagnosis.

As outlined in Table 1 for the main electrolyte imbalances, Potassium imbalances can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, QT prolongation weakness, fatigue, paralysis, respiratory distress. Phosphorus can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, decreased 2,3 DPG production, decreased respiratory muscle function. Magnesium can lead to ataxia, vertigo, paresthesia, convulsions, depression, QT prolongation. Thiamine deficiency can lead to cardiac dysfunction, Wernicke, and Korsakoff syndrome.", "contents": "Refeeding Syndrome -- Complications.

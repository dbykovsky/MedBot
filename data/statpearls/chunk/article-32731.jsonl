Even for proponents of the technique, radiosurgery is thought to have\u00a0a 2-year latency period before optimal risk reduction of recurrent hemorrhage occurs. While microsurgical resection remains the standard treatment for cavernomas, stereotactic radiosurgery is an option for solitary symptomatic lesions with an unacceptably high surgical risk. [3] [13] In general, it is not recommended for cavernous malformations that are asymptomatic, surgically accessible, or familial due to the risk of de novo cavernoma formation. [13]"}

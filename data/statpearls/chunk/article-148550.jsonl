They have multifaceted therapeutic benefits, including antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects. A recent Cochrane review found inadequate evidence to support using macrolides in chronic asthma to reduce exacerbations, oral steroid usage, quality of life, or rescue medication use. However, there is relatively little data regarding their use in asthma. [31] Macrolides could be useful in ACO patients with recurrent exacerbations and non-eosinophilic characteristics, but further investigation is required before drawing firm conclusions."}

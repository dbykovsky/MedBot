All interprofessional team members must monitor patient progress, document any concerns or status changes, and communicate promptly with the appropriate team members in the event therapeutic changes are in order. These examples show how an interprofessional team approach can optimize outcomes with secukinumab therapy. [Level 5]", "contents": "Secukinumab -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes. The common notion related to biologic therapy is the necessity for lifelong or long-term treatment, the failure of which can lead to incomplete resolution or recurrences. With secukinumab, relapses and recurrences are less frequent and can be preventable with a maintenance regime of fixed-interval dosing. Also, following patient education by an interprofessional team\u00a0including clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs), specialists (e.g., a rheumatologist), nurses, and pharmacists, subsequent doses can be self-administered increasing patient compliance and adherence. [7] The pharmacist can verify all dosing, check for drug-drug interactions, and counsel the patient on adverse events and signs that would warrant contacting their clinician. Nurses can also provide counsel, monitor therapeutic progress and adverse events, and verify patient compliance.

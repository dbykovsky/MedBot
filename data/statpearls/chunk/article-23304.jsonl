Although there is a lack of strong evidence supporting\u00a0the routine inclusion of triiodothyronine (T3) preparations with levothyroxine in the treatment of hypothyroidism, there might be a need to consider alternative combination T4 and T3 therapy in cases that do not respond to conventional T4 replacement.

Most evident, SCUBA diving causes an increase in metabolic oxygen consumption from the muscular contraction required to swim while carrying the necessary\u00a0gear. [2] Swimming in a 1-knot current is estimated to correspond to about 8 METs (metabolic equivalents). [3] Decreased heart rate is also common during diving due to the increased vagal tone associated with the mammalian diving reflex and the increased partial pressure of hyperbaric oxygen inhaled from the SCUBA tank. [2] Water immersion also exerts increased pressure on the vasculature relative to air, causing an increase in intrathoracic blood volume. [4] This increase in blood volume is associated with increased central venous pressure and cardiac output. [4]", "contents": "Cardiovascular Fitness To Dive -- Function.

However, if the ascent is too rapid, the micro-bubbles can form in the body's other tissues. There are\u00a02 recognized forms: minor and major. The minor type primarily affects the musculoskeletal system and is characterized by joint pain, itching, and skin changes. The major type is typified by neurological symptoms such as altered mental status, vertigo, confusion, and vision abnormalities.

[43] If the atresia is known, it may be reduced and re-explored at a 4 to 6-week interval to allow for decreased adhesions and inflammation. Atresia of the bowel can also be diagnosed following several weeks of no bowel function with a confirmatory contrast study. At the initial assessment of the gastroschisis, obvious bowel atresia can be turned into an end ostomy to allow the earlier resumption of feeding while waiting for the intestines to normalize.", "contents": "Gastroschisis -- Complications -- Management of Intestinal Atresia in the Setting of Gastroschisis.

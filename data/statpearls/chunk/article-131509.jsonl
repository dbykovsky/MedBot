However, this requires an overall energy restriction that leads to alterations in hormone concentrations, mitochondrial mechanisms, and EE from a metabolic standpoint. Less body fat and low-calorie intake indicate energy unavailability, substantiating a homeostatic endocrine response towards conserving energy and promoting energy intake. [33] Due to a change in energy metabolism, EE is structured to minimize energy deficits and weight loss,\u00a0thus promoting weight regain."}

These operations are also carried out to treat diabetes, high blood pressure, sleep apnea, and high cholesterol. These operations modify the stomach and intestines to treat obesity and comorbid conditions. The operation is intended to constrict the stomach size in addition to bypassing a stretch of the intestine. This changes food intake and absorption, resulting in less hunger and a feeling of fullness. Surgical intervention poses a risk factor for the patients; hence, assistance for interdisciplinary teams consisting of surgeons, nurses, and pharmacists is mandatory for assessment, post-operative patient care, monitoring, and follow-up. Furthermore, better outcomes can be enhanced by counseling and informing the patients about the goals and objectives of the bariatric surgery a priori.

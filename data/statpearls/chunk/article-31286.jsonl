For instance, superficial tenderness may be explained by allodynia which is a result of central nervous system sensitization. Additionally, the wind-up phenomenon may be a consequence of neuronal injury that subsequently leads to prolonged nociceptor input via c-fibers; this, in turn, leads to an exaggerated response to afferent input and an increase in the size of the skin\u2019s receptive field.

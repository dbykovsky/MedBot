USG use has significantly increased in the last decade to aid visualization of the nerve or plane for block placement, needle path, and the deposition of the LA.\u00a0There has also been a decrease in the use of nerve stimulator-guided/landmark techniques for block placement.\u00a0The anatomical\u00a0variations in growing children make landmark-guided approaches less reliable, especially\u00a0when the margin of safety is narrow. USG facilitates reduction in the doses of LA required to achieve adequate sensory and motor block required for the intra-\u00a0and postoperative analgesia. With the increasing use of USG over the years, the\u00a0incidence of neurological complications with peripheral nerve blocks in children\u00a0has\u00a0been decreasing.\u00a0A good quality USG with appropriate presets for neurological (for nerve blocks) or musculoskeletal (for plane\u00a0blocks)\u00a0is recommended.\u00a0The most useful\u00a0transducer\u00a0probes for\u00a0pediatric regional anesthesia are linear\u00a0arrays, which have a smaller footprint and a broad range of frequency (6\u00a0to 13 MHz) to\u00a0image both superficial and deep structures.\u00a0Curved array probes might be required for\u00a0adolescents and obese patients\u00a0for deep blocks."}

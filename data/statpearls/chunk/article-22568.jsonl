Hematuria has been noted as a marker of kidney injury but has not been correlated with thrombocytopenia. [14] [15] [16]", "contents": "Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome -- Staging. By the time a patient requires hospitalization, transformation into the second stage of the disease has most likely already developed, with cough and vomiting dominating the clinical presentation. Orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, and tachypnea will likely all be present. Platelet count is the first significant abnormal laboratory test, which is also the most useful.

However, almost half of the patients admitted with Hantavirus will not require mechanical ventilation via intubation if appropriately managed with judicious fluids and close monitoring.Should patients improve within the first few days, there is a good probability of extubation within the first week, and there are often no major long-term complications. However, subjective complaints of dyspnea, fatigue, and myalgias may occur. Higher titers of antibodies neutralizing the viral nucleocapsid immune complexes correlate with a higher likelihood of survival.", "contents": "Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome -- Prognosis.

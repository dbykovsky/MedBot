Humans are infected through infected mosquito\u00a0bites while visiting or working in the jungle. The intermediate cycle occurs in the African savannah and involves humans who live or work in jungle border areas. Transmission may be between monkeys and humans or humans via mosquito vectors.

Humans develop significant viremia to infect mosquitoes, which can then transmit the virus to other humans in urban areas.

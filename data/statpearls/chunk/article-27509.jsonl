The nerves of the brachial plexus and subclavian vessels run along the anterior shoulder girdle between the first rib and clavicle and can be prone to injury, but this is much less common in posterior dislocations. Dislocations can occur with any injury to the shoulder, whether it be traumatic, blunt, or a twisting type of injury. The most common mechanism is forceful adduction with internal rotation, but a direct, blunt blow to the anterior shoulder may also result in dislocation.

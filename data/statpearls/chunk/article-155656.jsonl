Some programs offered in Medicare, Medicaid, and Military settings and at the VA may have issues of concern that could impact their clinical significance and effectiveness. For example, the VA's Choice Program, which provides veterans access to care outside of the VA system, has been criticized for its complex eligibility criteria and long wait times, which can delay access to care and potentially compromise patient outcomes. Similarly, the Medicaid program has faced challenges in ensuring access to care for individuals with low income or disabilities, particularly in states that have not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.

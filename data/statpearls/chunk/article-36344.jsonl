A 6-carbon sugar, glucose, may enter the glycolytic pathway or enter the alternative HMP shunt depending on the cell\u2019s individual needs at the time. Once the glucose enters the HMP shunt, it undergoes a series of reactions, broken down into the oxidative(irreversible) and non-oxidative phases (reversible). The oxidative phase is responsible for converting the intermediate glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphogluconate, using the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzyme. The by-product of this reaction is the important molecule NADPH. 6-phosphogluconate then converts into ribulose-5-phosphate, and NADPH gets produced again as a by-product.

A pathology that can arise is the deficiency of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, the enzyme required to produce NADPH in the initial step of the HMP shunt. The consequences are mostly seen in red blood cells as the cells can no longer defend against the constant introduction of oxidizing agents. This condition of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is an X-linked recessive disorder, most commonly seen in African Americans. The deficiency leads to hemolytic anemia in response to any of the offending agents such as fava beans, medications like nitrofurantoin, or anti-malarial drugs. Infections are the most likely offending agents to exacerbate this condition as the inflammation introduces free radicals into red blood cells that cannot detoxify those radicals, and oxidative damage ensues. The damage occurs as the injury causes protein and globin chains to denature within the red blood cells. The globin chains aggregate and form the characteristic Heinz bodies seen in G6PD deficient patients. Consequently, the spleen phagocytoses the aggregated portion of the RBC and leaves the remnant bite cells in circulation to create degmacytes, or bite cells, as seen in a peripheral smear of these patients. Although detrimental to the health, this condition does confer a degree of resistance to malaria as the parasites require the reduced form of glutathione to proliferate while these patients only have the oxidized form in the red blood cells. Thus, the evolutionary advantage maintains a deficiency in the African American population. [7] [8] [9] Another use of the HMP shunt in medicine is its use in diagnosing patients with thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. Thiamine deficient patients present with a wide array of symptoms, ranging from Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome to dry or wet beriberi. Wernicke-Korsakoff is characterized by a triad of ataxia,\u00a0ophthalmoplegia, and confabulations. Wet beriberi can result in cardiac failure and dilated cardiomyopathies, while dry beriberi results in sequelae of neurological symptoms. As thiamine deficiency can lead to so many complications and potentially become fatal, it is important to detect the deficiency promptly. The deficiency is tested by administering thiamine to a suspected patient and detecting the activity of the transketolase enzyme of HMP shunt within red blood cells. If transketolase activity increases, it confirms the diagnosis of thiamine deficiency. As such, thiamine, as well as dextrose, is administered since thiamine deficiency causes impaired glucose breakdown.

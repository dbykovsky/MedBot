These factors influence the high turnover rate for healthcare professionals at these facilities, leading to an overall shortage of medical personnel in AIAN communities. To fill the gaps, IHS and tribal healthcare facilities contract temporary providers with limited knowledge of the AIAN population (particularly the local population they serve) and are often not interested in staying long-term. This leads to chronic understaffing, poor continuity of care, and decreased access to care. [38] [2] Increasing funding and providing sustainable staffing models in IHS and tribally operated healthcare facilities can help address barriers to adequate healthcare access. IHS's systematic underfunding and under-sourcing have directly contributed to significant inequities in healthcare delivery and health status for AIANs. [39] To address health disparities and properly care for AIAN patients, increasing funding for healthcare services in AIAN communities is vital."}

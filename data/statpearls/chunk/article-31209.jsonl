[5] [1] The vital capacity of a typical adult is between 3 and 5 liters. Factors that affect a person\u2019s vital capacity include age, sex, height, weight, and ethnicity. For instance, the residual volume and the functional residual capacity increase with age, resulting in a decrease in the vital capacity. Vital capacity has been found to increase with an increase in the height of a person, whereas, an increasing body mass index (BMI) is shown to correlate with a lower vital capacity.

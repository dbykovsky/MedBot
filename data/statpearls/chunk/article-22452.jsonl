Its production is tightly regulated through several complex feedback mechanisms in response to stress, exercise, nutrition, sleep, and growth hormone itself. The primary regulation factors are growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) produced in the hypothalamus, somatostatin, produced in various tissues throughout the body, and ghrelin, which is produced in the gastrointestinal tract. GHRH functions to promote HGH production and release. Somatostatin inhibits the release of GHRH as well as the HGH release response to GHRH stimulus and increases in hypoglycemia.

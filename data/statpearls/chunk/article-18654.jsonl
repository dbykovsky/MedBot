Hamad et al.\u00a0report a series of 50 patients undergoing bronchial stump coverage with pericardium following extrapleural pneumonectomy for malignant mesothelioma. [48] Although two patients died secondary to cardiac complications, leading to 4% perioperative mortality, there were no cases of BPF. Lastly, Lardinois et al.\u00a0conducted a non-randomized comparison study of 26 patients undergoing either intercostal muscle or diaphragm flaps (DF). [49] Thirty-day mortality was zero in both groups. There was a higher incidence of complications, including pneumonia, atelectasis, herniation, and BPF in the DF group, 38% versus 8% in the intercostal muscle flap group. Both methods were deemed effective by the authors.", "contents": "Bronchopleural Fistula -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes. Deschamps et al.\u00a0analyzed 713 pneumonectomy patients.

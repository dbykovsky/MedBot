Inflammatory bowel disease requires consultation with a gastroenterologist. For rheumatoid arthritis/psoriatic arthritis, consultation with a rheumatologist is needed. However, all interprofessional healthcare team members (clinicians, nurses, pharmacists) should work together to ensure that the patient has had a proper workup for tuberculosis, hepatitis B, and cardiac status evaluated before administering the drug. Close monitoring of the patient by a specialty-trained nurse is necessary, as the drug does have mild to moderate adverse effects. A clinical pharmacist can also provide valuable input on dosing and drug-drug interactions and answer patient questions about the medication.", "contents": "Infliximab -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

Over\u00a01 year, 1800 referrals for advanced IBD therapies were received, including medications such as infliximab. Of these referrals, 98% of patients successfully initiated the intended treatment. Despite encountering insurance denials in 17% of cases, the team overturned many through appeals and obtained manufacturer-patient assistance programs for some patients, including those prescribed infliximab. The clinical pharmacy team also conducted over 2000 pharmacist-initiated interventions, primarily focusing on preventing therapy interruptions and providing patient education. These findings underscore the valuable role of clinical pharmacy teams in optimizing patient care and medication access within IBD centers, suggesting their integration as a best practice.

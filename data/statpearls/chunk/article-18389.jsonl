These professionals undergo thorough training in screening potential blood donors, using sterile collection methods, and overseeing the blood donation process. Although adverse effects from blood donation are rare, the most frequent complication is the occurrence of a local traumatic hematoma upon needle removal. Applying pressure and using ice or cold compresses in the affected area can aid in preventing the formation or progression of hematomas. While these hematomas are typically small and do not pose significant issues, there is a rare possibility that they may advance to cause damage to neighboring structures and tissues. Therefore, it is crucial to monitor the hematoma closely for the potential development of local damage. [7]", "contents": "Blood Donation -- Complications.

During syncopal episodes associated with blood donation, there is typically a decrease in systolic blood pressure and pulse. The blood donor may experience weakness, sweating, dizziness, or pallor symptoms. The donation is temporarily halted or discontinued, and supportive measures are initiated when syncope occurs. Post-donation syncope may also occur, and the risk can be reduced by having the donor sit in a reclined position for a few minutes. When feasible, donors should gradually transition from a reclined position to an upright one and then move to an area where they can consume food and beverages. Encouraging increased fluid intake and advising against consuming alcoholic or caffeinated beverages over the following few hours can aid in replenishing the lost circulating volume.

Photoreceptor cells in the outer layers of the retina, which are called rods and cones, convert light stimuli into neuronal impulses. These signals are then relayed to the bipolar cells, which interact with ganglion cells, which in turn coalesce to form the optic disc and optic nerve (CN II). The optic nerve sends impulses to the brain for further processing and image recognition. [1] These are the first steps of the pupillary light reflex afferent pathway. The optic nerve then forms the optic chiasm, which diverges into a left and right optic tract. At the optic chiasm, nasal retinal fibers will cross to the contralateral side of the optic tract, and the temporal retinal fibers continue on the ipsilateral side. Thus, the right optic tract will contain temporal retinal fibers from the right eye, as well as nasal retinal fibers from the left eye. The optic tracts join the brachium of the superior colliculus, and then signals travel to the pretectal area of the midbrain. Each pretectal area sends bilateral signals to the preganglionic parasympathetic nuclei in the midbrain called Edinger-Westphal nuclei. [2] [3] There are a minority of axons that go to the hypothalamus and the olivary pretectal nucleus (OPN). [4] Efferent parasympathetic preganglionic fibers travel on the oculomotor nerve and synapse with the ciliary ganglion, which sends postganglionic axons to directly innervate the iris sphincter muscles.

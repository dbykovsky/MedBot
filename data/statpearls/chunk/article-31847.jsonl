Law enforcement refers to the fatal funnel as a doorway where one can be easily seen but is difficult to move out of in the case of incoming projectiles. A police officer never stands in front of a doorway, especially an open door, during a high-risk incident. The unknown is one of the most dangerous aspects of the tactical environment, similar to unsearched areas or the other side of the doors. Additionally, walls afford some cover and concealment from the 3 \"Bs:\" bombs, bullets, and bad guys. Open doors afford none. Since movement is paramount in a tactical environment, slow and methodical movements are necessary but can be extremely uncomfortable and challenging. Another aspect of the tactical movement is to avoid projecting presence. This is where terms like \"slicing the pie\" and \"quick peeks\" come into play. Slicing the pie is used to look into open doorways, gaining a perspective for as much of the space on the other side of the door by looking from different angles. Whatever cannot be viewed by slicing the pie may be viewed by conducting \"quick peeks.\" This is when an officer lines up on the wall adjacent to the door and quickly looks inside the doorway to the left and right without telescoping their head. Officers have their firearms in hand, and the shooting hand penetrates the doorway simultaneously with their heads.

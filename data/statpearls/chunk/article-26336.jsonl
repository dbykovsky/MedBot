Genetic counseling and testing for family members help identify carriers and prevent potential complications. Delayed diagnosis may lead to severe complications and neurocognitive deficits. Newborn screening programs may aid in early detection and management. Inadequate adherence to dietary restrictions and medication regimens can result in metabolic decompensation. Collaborative care involving various specialists, such as geneticists, nephrologists, and dieticians, is essential for comprehensive management. Genetic counseling and testing for family members can inform carriers and guide preventive measures. Adherence to dietary restrictions, medications, and regular follow-ups is crucial for preventing hyperammonemic crises.", "contents": "Ornithine Transcarbamylase Deficiency -- Pearls and Other Issues.

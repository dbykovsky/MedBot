The prompt diagnosis and management of hyperlipidemia results in the reversal of most of the symptoms and can prevent life-threatening complications like acute pancreatitis. The detection of a mutation of the LPL gene can help in genetic counseling of the parents of the affected child. Secondary causes like diabetes, hypothyroidism, obesity, chronic alcoholism, etc. need to be diagnosed and promptly treated. This management is possible only if there are proper communication and referral of the case between physicians, pediatricians, geneticists, endocrinologists, and ophthalmologists. The team can also include optometrists, laboratory technicians, and ophthalmology nurses. The laboratory technicians identify the unprocessed sample of blood in the test tube for any abnormal discoloration. The nurses participate in patient education and follow up, informing the ophthalmologist of any issues.", "contents": "Lipemia Retinalis -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

[24]", "contents": "Fludeoxyglucose (18F) -- Administration -- Special Population. COVID-19 Vaccination: Transient FDG uptake in axillary, supraclavicular, and cervical lymph nodes is noted after ipsilateral deltoid vaccination, which may confound interpretation in patients with cancer FDG PET/CT. [23] Therefore, the COVID-19 Task Force Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI) recommends that it is essential to acknowledge that FDG-avid lymphadenopathy can occur in the axillary, lower cervical, and supraclavicular lymph nodes ipsilateral to the vaccination site. FDG-avid lymphadenopathy can be seen for 4\u00a0to 6 weeks or longer after the most recent dose of the vaccination. Consequently, questionnaires should be revised to include details about the dates and sites of vaccination and which vaccine was administered. If possible, the COVID-19 vaccination should be administered in the contralateral arm for patients with a history of breast, head, and neck cancers. These recommendations may help oncologists decide the appropriate workup and suggest that breast cancer patients be vaccinated on their healthy side to avoid unnecessary biopsies. In approximately half the patients receiving the novel mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, PET/CT demonstrated avid ipsilateral lymphadenopathy, significantly less common in immunocompromised and elderly patients. These results suggest that 18F-FDG PET/CT may give a clue regarding the patient's immune response to the vaccination. [24]"}

Appropriate health education regarding excessive weight gain in pregnancy should also be emphasized to all expecting mothers during antenatal classes. It is currently recommended to screen patients with gestational diabetes during the postpartum phase for the development of prediabetes or type 2 diabetes mellitus. Women who develop gestational diabetes have three to seven times an increased likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus within five to ten years after delivery.", "contents": "Macrosomia -- Deterrence and Patient Education.

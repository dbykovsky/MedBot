Subsequently, the jejunum is divided between 15 to 20 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz, and the jejunal mesentery is divided, staying close to the specimen until the jejunal specimen can be passed into the supramesocolic compartment through the ligament of Trietz. Preparing for pancreatic transection involves placing stay sutures on either side of the proposed line, and the pancreas is then divided, either sharply or with electrocautery. Caution is exercised to avoid injuring the underlying superior mesenteric vein/portal vein, and small bleeders on the cut pancreatic surface are typically cauterized. The pancreatic remnant ductal margin is sent for frozen histopathology. If vascular resection is necessary, the pancreas is not divided until proximal and distal control of the superior mesenteric, portal, and splenic veins is established. The pancreas is gently separated from the superior mesenteric vein and portal vein, with attention to draining venous branches in the uncinate process, and dissection continues until the superior mesenteric vein and the right border of the superior mesenteric artery are skeletonized, culminating in specimen removal.", "contents": "Pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple Procedure) -- Technique or Treatment -- Pancreatic Resection.

Commonly used topical ophthalmic antibiotics are ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and gatifloxacin due to their broad spectrum coverage. Ophthalmic ointment formulations have a better retention time, so they should be used at night. Ophthalmic solutions like sulfacetamide are easy to apply and improve patient compliance. [31] Oral antibiotics have a limited role\u00a0and are used only when there is an associated scleral infection or endophthalmitis. [32]"}

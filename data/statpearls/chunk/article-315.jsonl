While it did not gain much esteem in health care due to poor analgesia and adverse effects, including seizure-like activity, GHB gained significant popularity as a sleep aid, bodybuilding, and weight loss supplement. GHB was prohibited by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 1990 and is currently a Schedule I drug in the United States. It has been labeled a date rape drug and is also illicitly used for recreational purposes, particularly at dance clubs and raves. Street names include G, Gamma OH, Georgia Home Boy, Liquid Ecstasy, and Liquid X. [1] [2] [3] [4]", "contents": "Gamma-Hydroxybutyrate Toxicity -- Introduction.

Higher doses initially inhibit dopamine release via agonist effects on GABA-B receptors, leading to neuro-inhibition and central nervous system (CNS) depression, but after that increase dopamine release via the GHB receptor.

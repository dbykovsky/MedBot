Perhaps this decision should be made by the anesthesiologist in the preoperative area, after measurement of BP and auscultation of the lungs.

The continuous relationship between\u00a0increasing BP\u00a0and increased morbidity and mortality has been demonstrated at all ages. Furthermore, the treatment of elevated SBP has been shown to significantly reduce total mortality, CVD, coronary heart disease-related mortality, and stroke. [34] [35] Although SBP appears to be a better predictor of events than DBP after age 50, high DBP is associated with increased CVD risk and is more commonly elevated in patients < 50 years of age, compared with older patients. The strong association between elevated DBP and morbidity and mortality was reported in two studies, one in veterans whose DBP ranged between 115 and 129 mm Hg,\u00a0and one in veterans with DBP 90 to 114 mm Hg. [36] [37] DBP tends to decline from starting at midlife due to arterial stiffening. Consequently, SBP assumes even greater importance as a risk factor starting at midlife. [38]"}

[39] Marked systolic HTN is associated with a frequent occurrence of APE. Most literature explains APE as a consequence of ischemia decreasing systolic function. This results in secretion of norepinephrine, release of renin-angiotensin due to decreased renal perfusion, and sometimes activation of the autonomic nervous system. The fact that marked HTN results in APE in patients who have been revascularized, as well as in patients who have not been revascularized, suggests that HTN alone may be the etiology of APE in some patients. [40] Indeed, these authors reported not only that the reoccurrence of APE is similar in patients with normal and decreased LVEF, but also in patients with and without CAD. [40] Furthermore, in patients who were revascularized, CHF was not less common than in patients with CAD who were not revascularized. Since BP is often severely elevated during APE, in at least some patients, HTN itself may be the cause of APE. [13] In fact, in a study of patients with APE and severe HTN due to renovascular disease, surgical correction of the renal vasculature resulted in a dramatic decrease in the incidence of APE, even in patients in whom BP did not normalize. [41] DD may also result in APE, but the clinical picture may be less severe due to preserved systolic function. Maintenance of both BP and heart rate in an appropriate range will minimize the risk of perioperative CHF. The judicious administration of crystalloids, colloids, and blood products is also important in this regard. Central venous and pulmonary artery pressures may be useful for trending, but no specific values ensure appropriate volume status, as both these measurements are influenced by cardiac pathologies, such as LVH, decreased compliance, and valvular heart disease. When optimization of volume status is judged essential, either TTE or TEE, as appropriate for the location of the surgical incision, are advised. If TTE/TEE are unavailable, esophageal Doppler can be used to measure cardiac output and stroke volume.

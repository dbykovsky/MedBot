Trichoepithelioma\u00a0is a lesion that\u00a0originates from hair follicles in sun-exposed areas on the face and scalp. It presents as multiple (in the inherited form) or single (in the sporadic form)\u00a0skin-colored\u00a0lesions\u00a02 to 8 mm in size. [34] Trichofolliculoma resembles a sebaceous cyst, often with a central umbilication that contains white hair. [35] Trichilemmoma resembles verruca or BCC and consists of smooth and well-defined papules or verrucous growths that\u00a0may be solitary or multiple. [36] Pilomatrixoma presents as a\u00a0solitary, subcutaneous, pink to a purple, painless, firm nodule that grows over months to years. It is normally 15 to 30 mm in size, but much larger lesions of up to 15 cm have been reported. It\u00a0is more often found in the upper eyelid or eyebrow and can resemble a chalazion. It often contains a calcified center. [37]"}

If removed, junctional nevi are less likely to recur as the nevus cells are more superficial than intradermal and compound nevi. Non-dysplastic nevi (junctional, intradermal, and compound) have a relatively low risk of transforming melanoma. One study reported a rate of transformation of 1 in 200,000 of any non-dysplastic nevus for men and women under the age of\u00a040 years. However, over 40, the risk of transformation goes up, and by age 80, the risk of any mole converting to melanoma is 1 in 3000 for males and 1 in 11,000 for females. [73] The presence of dysplastic nevi is a strong risk for melanoma. In one study, subjects with one dysplastic nevus had a 1.6 increased odds ratio of melanoma, while patients with over four nevi had a 10.5 odds ratio. The risk of a single dysplastic nevus transforming is still quite low and estimated to be about 1 in 40,000 for females and 1 in 30,000 for males. [73]"}

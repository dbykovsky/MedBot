[20] Both the ulnar and radial arteries are useful as potential coronary artery bypass grafts. [21] The radial artery is the primary site for placement of arterial lines that have a use for blood pressure monitoring during surgery. Due to collateral circulation at the wrist and hand, which receive blood from the radial, ulnar, and interosseous arteries, occlusion or harvest of the radial or ulnar arteries usually does not cause complications such as ischemia of the hand. However, patients with anatomic variations of the arteries of the hand can develop ischemia. The radial artery can spasm during the placement of catheters or sheaths into it, and medications such as nitroglycerin and verapamil can be used to prevent or reduce spasm."}

This is becoming more common as evidence suggests that there are fewer vascular access complications when using the radial artery compared to the femoral artery, without any negative effects on the success of the procedure.

Anatomic variants such as a brachioradial artery may make procedures using radial access more difficult. The vessel may be tortuous near its origin and navigating it could prove difficult. The radial artery has a smaller diameter than the common femoral artery, which limits the size of the sheaths and catheters that can be used.", "contents": "Anatomy, Shoulder and Upper Limb, Forearm Arteries -- Clinical Significance -- Radial Artery Access.

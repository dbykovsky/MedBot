Routine recommended antibiotics regimens and duration for common enterococcal infections. (a) Given the bacteriostatic effect of beta-lactams on enterococci at the usual doses, combination therapy with a beta-lactam (usually ampicillin) plus an aminoglycoside (specifically gentamicin or streptomycin) for 4 to 6 weeks has been the standard to achieve bacteriocidal action against enterococci in cases of IE. This prolonged use of aminoglycosides often causes nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, as highlighted in the old paper \u201cDeaf or Dead\u201d Most recently, a two beta-lactam combination with ampicillin and ceftriaxone for six weeks duration has shown to be an equal alternative, with less toxicity leading to less interruption, and an effective option for HLAR isolates.

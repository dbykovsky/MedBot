{"id": "article-18282_3", "title": "Impaired Bilirubin Conjugation -- Etiology", "content": "Seventy percent to 90% of bilirubin is derived from red blood cell heme. [5] [6] [7] Heme oxygenase converts this heme to biliverdin, which is converted by biliverdin reductase to unconjugated bilirubin (UCB). UCB bound to albumin enters the hepatocyte, where it binds glutathione-S-transferases superfamily members, which present it for conjugation. The process of conjugation occurs in two steps. Bilirubin monoglucuronide initially forms through the transfer of a glucuronic acid molecule to a carboxyl group of bilirubin through the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGTA1A), which is located in the endoplasmic reticulum. One more glucuronic acid molecule is added to a second carboxyl group of bilirubin to form bilirubin diglucuronide. This overall process allows bilirubin to become water-soluble for easier transport. Bilirubin diglucuronide can be excreted into bile or secreted into the plasma for reuptake. Disorders of impaired bilirubin conjugation fundamentally arise from the impaired activity of the UGTA1A enzyme. Gilbert syndrome and Crigler-Najjar syndrome have inherited diseases that cause impaired bilirubin conjugation. Lucy-Driscoll syndrome is also a rare inherited disorder that can potentially contribute to severe transient familial unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in an infant\u2019s early life. Infants and mothers with this syndrome contain an unknown factor that inhibits UGTA1A enzyme activity. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia can also manifest as neonatal jaundice because of immature UGTA1A enzyme activity and increased breakdown of fetal erythrocytes. Protease inhibitors, pregnanediol, novobiocin, chloramphenicol, and gentamycin, are common drugs that inhibit the UGTA1A enzyme (See Image.

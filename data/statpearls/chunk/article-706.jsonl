In 2014 the Eight Joint Nation Committee (JNC-8) established goals for hypertension management. Clinicians should indirectly monitor the therapeutic index through blood pressure control and evaluation for side effects. Typically well-tolerated mild side effects have been previously reported, including but not limited to dizziness, headache, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and electrolyte disturbances, for instance,\u00a0hyperkalemia.

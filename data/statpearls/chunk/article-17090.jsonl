This facilitates the penetration of the stain inside each bacterium. Care must be taken that boiling does not occur as that may alter the results of the test. The stain and smear should remain in contact for approximately 10 minutes and be allowed to cool down thereafter, thus, trapping the stain within the bacterial cell wall. These steps make the entire smear, including acid-fast bacilli, red. After stain fixation, the second step focuses on washing the excess stain off from the smear. This is done by gently washing the smear in a stream of water and then covering it with acid alcohol for 2 to 3 minutes.

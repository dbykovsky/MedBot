However, care should be taken to minimize tricuspid valve tissue sampling during biopsies in patients who are known to expect frequent EMB procedures. The overall complication rate and the number of inconclusive samples are rather low, with severe adverse events in less than 1% and minor incidents up to 6% of procedures. [18]"}

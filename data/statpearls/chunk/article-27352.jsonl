A restrictive IV fluid strategy is usually employed in the absence of severe hemodynamic instability and ongoing blood loss. This is associated with a lower incidence of acute lung injury and enhanced recovery after surgery. [17] Vasopressors are usually preferred over IV fluid boluses to correct hypotension associated with general anesthesia. It should also be noted that\u00a0using colloids like albumin has not been shown to be superior to crystalloids for volume expansion. [18]"}

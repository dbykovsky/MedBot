The oligodendrocytes in the CNS produce myelin.\u00a0Myelin\u00a0forms insulating sheaths around\u00a0axons to allow the swift travel of electrical impulses through the axons. The nodes of Ranvier are gaps in the myelin sheath of axons, allowing sodium influx into the axon to help maintain the speed of the electrical impulse traveling through the axon. This transmission\u00a0is\u00a0called\u00a0saltatory nerve conduction, the\u00a0\"jumping\" of electrical impulses from one node to another. It ensures that electrical signals do not lose their velocity and can propagate long distances without signal deterioration. [22]"}

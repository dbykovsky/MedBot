Current evidence suggests that drusen bodies are composed of cholesterol-containing lipid droplets forming the core structure upon which hydroxyapatite (HAP) spherules precipitate. These HAP spherules facilitate protein deposition to their surface which results in an oligomerization process ultimately forming the sub-RPE deposits. One focus of the study has been the proteins involved in the formation of drusen, and many different proteins have been implicated in this process. Some of the most common proteins involved include amyloid-beta, apolipoproteins, vitronectin, and complement proteins. [2] [3] [4]", "contents": "Drusen Bodies -- Definition/Introduction.

Hard drusen are common and are the only type of drusen considered as normal age-associated findings. [5] A few small drusen noted on an exam is not alarming, however, there is some thought that these drusen have the potential to enlarge and develop more worrisome characteristics as time progresses. Intermediate drusen are\u00a0the hybrid form of drusen defined as a diameter between 63 microns to 125 microns. These larger drusen tend to be classified within the soft drusen category. Soft drusen are defined as larger, poorly-defined drusen with mound-like elevations and a diameter measuring greater than 125 microns. [2] It is believed that larger drusen bodies contribute to the impediment of the exchange of nutrients and waste products between the choroidal blood vessels and the retina. [4] The lack of metabolic exchange eventually leads to degeneration and atrophy of the retina which is the pathological process seen in AMD. Cuticular drusen are\u00a0defined as small, dot-like drusen which measure between 25 microns to 75 microns. Cuticular drusen are numerous and often aggregate.

Inner core cells are derived from Schwann cells and are involved in the conduction of signals. These lamellar layers are separated from each other by a fluid-filled layer, kept in between due to the presence of tight junctions found between adjacent lamellar cells. A capsule surrounds the outer lamellar layer. When a vibratory stimulus deforms skin, this stimulus reaches the dermis where it transmits to the external capsule of PCs. This distortion travels through the external and internal core until it reaches the central neurite.

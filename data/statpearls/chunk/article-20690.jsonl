Once\u00a0inserted, the DLT\u00a0is connected to the ventilator circuit via the DLT connector, and the detection of ETCO2 confirms placement in the trachea after both cuffs are inflated to seal leaks. No more than 3 mL of air should be required to create a seal in the bronchial cuff. Cuff pressures should\u00a0be measured to prevent airway injury.\u00a0Confirmation of correct positioning of the DLT can\u00a0be done\u00a0by auscultation or with fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Auscultation and bilateral chest wall movement is first confirmed. On clamping the endobronchial lumen limb connector, breath sounds should be absent from the corresponding side of the lung if the endobronchial lumen is in the correct bronchus. On clamping the endotracheal limb connector and ventilating through the endobronchial lumen, breath sounds should be absent from the opposite side of the chest."}

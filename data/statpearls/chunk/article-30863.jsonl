The presence of the true pathogenic agent can be obscured due to the contamination, whether due to an overgrowth or an inhibition of the true pathogens. Even more than that, the medium in which the specimen is stored also plays a significant role in the true urinary pathogen. Inhibition of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae have been observed with the use of boric acid as the storage and preservation medium. [32] Owing to these issues with contamination and obscuration of true UTI-causative organisms, misdiagnosis, and subsequent poor patient management and faulty antibiotic stewardship will result, with the most feared complication becoming a complicated UTI and possibly leading to urosepsis. [1] Consequently, proper detection of UTI or asymptomatic bacteriuria is of paramount importance. For instance, swift detection of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy is necessary in order to prevent the feared complication of pyelonephritis with subsequent harm to the child. [33] Ordering urine cultures when indicated and proper handling of the urine specimen provides for proper diagnosis and therefore preventing complications associated with poorly diagnosed and treated UTI."}

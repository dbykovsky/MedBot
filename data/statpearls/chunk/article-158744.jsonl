Despite these refusals being a source of legal liability, the patient still retains the right to determine medical decisions in their best interests, even if the resultant refusal results in deterioration or death; see Lane v. Candura, 376 N.E.d 1232, 1978. [13] Decisional capacity, informed refusals, and awareness of the limitations of the prehospital clinicians must be noted and documented. [12] On the contrary, the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution offers protection against false imprisonment.[Wideman v DeKalb County, 409 A. 2d 537, 1991] In the case of an allegedly suicidal Wyoming patient, immunity was not available to paramedics who restrained and transported the patient to the hospital [Moore v. Wyoming Medical Center, 825 F. Supp 1531, 1993.]. Involuntary restraint of a patient who demonstrates decisional capacity could lead to charges of false imprisonment, battery, and assault. [14]"}

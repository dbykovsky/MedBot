Megaloblastic anemia occurs due to vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency can occur via many mechanisms, but in PA, this occurs due to a lack of intrinsic factor (IF). Intrinsic factor is a glycoprotein that binds cobalamin and therefore enables its absorption at the terminal ileum.\u00a0Pernicious anemia is an autoimmune disorder that occurs due to autoantibodies directed against IF or gastric parietal cells (that produce IF). [1] These antibodies lead to the destruction of gastric parietal cells or prevent the absorption of vitamin B12 by blocking IF binding sites for this vitamin. As a result, vitamin B12 cannot be absorbed from the alimentary canal, and vitamin B12-associated megaloblastic anemia occurs.", "contents": "Pernicious Anemia (Nursing) -- Introduction.

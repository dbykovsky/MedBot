Subsequently, the contrast transit time is determined, ensuring maximal opacification of coronary vessels during the scan. This is achieved through the 'test-bolus' method, where contrast enhancement in the ascending aorta is timed at the carina level, surrogate the time required for contrast to reach the coronary arteries. Following this, parameters for image acquisition are meticulously set. The 'half-scan' reconstruction algorithm, characterized by simultaneous gantry rotation and scanner bed advancement, creating a spiral trajectory (termed 'spiral' or 'helical' CT), is commonly employed. An optimal 'pitch,' representing the ratio of bed movement to gantry rotation, is chosen to avoid overlap or gaps in reconstruction. A balance is struck as higher overlapping aids in omitting undesired image sets, enabling subsequent reconstruction. However, lower pitches result in greater radiation exposure. Fast-pitch scanners reduce acquisition time and radiation exposure but are best suited for lower heart rates. The alternative mode, 'step and shoot,' maintains a static scanner bed while the gantry orbits the patient, generating a series of axial images.", "contents": "Coronary CT Angiography -- Technique or Treatment -- Image Acquisition.

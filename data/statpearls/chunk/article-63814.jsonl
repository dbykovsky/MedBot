[21] Learning in a simulated environment that encourages error management strategies and the discussion of errors within teams may promote communication and shared cognition among team members. [27] Additionally, EMT has been demonstrated to improve emotional regulation in the setting of errors, [16] and this type of training may be particularly crucial in high-stress fields such as medicine. [27] There is an excellent opportunity to integrate EMT into both individual and team-based training in the simulation environment for a wide array of healthcare providers and specialties. Both trainees and practicing clinicians could benefit from this training. Overall, EMT has great potential to change the culture of training and communication in healthcare, and more instructors should familiarize themselves with the theoretical underpinnings that support EMT-based curricula.

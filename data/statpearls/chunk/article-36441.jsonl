[1]", "contents": "Iron-Binding Capacity -- Clinical Significance. In iron overload states, such as hereditary hemochromatosis, conditions associated with transfusion dependency seen in myeloid disorders, or thalassemias, which can present in later years with an increased ability to absorb and store iron, TIBC levels are low with proportional increases in iron saturation levels. [51] The initial treatment for hereditary hemochromatosis is therapeutic phlebotomy to keep ferritin levels under 50\u00a0to 100 ng/mL while keeping hemoglobin levels above 11 g/dL. Iron chelators are employed in other cases of iron overload and coexisting anemia, where therapeutic phlebotomies are unsafe. Iron chelators are available as oral or parenteral formulations. [1]"}

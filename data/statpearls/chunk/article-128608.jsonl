[35] Aging tubes, changes in vacuum levels, or gas molecules within the tube can contribute to arcing. [35] It can lead to various artifacts, from minor streaks to severe image distortion. Reporting the issue to a service engineer for evaluation and potential resolution is essential when tube arcing occurs."}

These artifacts can be minimized by using a low pitch when possible. [13] In MDCT helical systems, the \"cone beam effect\" can lead to artifacts, especially in the outer detector rows, and these become more pronounced with a larger cone beam. [13] Some protocols restrict data acquisition to the center rows to improve image quality. [13] Additionally, various artifacts can occur when creating three-dimensional (3D) or differently oriented images from the original scan data, so care is needed in multiplanar or 3D reconstructions.

{"id": "article-128608_29", "title": "CT Instrumentation and Physics -- Clinical Significance", "content": "Understanding the physics of CT is fundamental to grasping the clinical significance of artifact recognition and management. CT physics underpins the principles governing image acquisition and reconstruction, which impacts image quality and directly relates to its usefulness in providing an accurate diagnosis. For example, an image of an infant using a shallow technique may appear quite noisy. However, it may still be adequate if the image is taken to follow up a significant abnormality, such as an abscess. Radiologists and technologists must comprehend the physics-related factors that can introduce artifacts to the images, such as beam hardening, partial volume effects, and metallic artifacts. This knowledge empowers them to identify these artifacts promptly and employ appropriate corrective measures. An in-depth understanding of CT physics enhances diagnostic accuracy and ensures patients receive optimized care. By minimizing image artifacts, clinicians can make more precise diagnoses, reduce the need for repeat scans, limit radiation exposure, and expedite the initiation of necessary medical interventions. Ultimately, comprehending CT physics elevates the clinical significance of artifact recognition and management, benefiting patients and healthcare providers.", "contents": "CT Instrumentation and Physics -- Clinical Significance.

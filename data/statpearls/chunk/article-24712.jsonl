[1] However, this activity does not constrain itself to the (theoretical) management skills per se. It is because effective and efficient healthcare managers require elements of leadership skills to fulfill managerial roles and responsibilities at the best possible level.\u00a0The necessary skills of healthcare managers involve planning, organizing, implementing, monitoring, and evaluation skills. Planning refers to the preparation of the steps and protocols needed to achieve an ultimate end goal and the proper allocation of anticipated resources (including human resources) to the objectives and goals of the healthcare organization. Development of a plan can refer to action plans addressing small-scale activities for individual staff as well as operational and strategic plans for small groups (i.e., sections, units, departments) or organization-wide level. A pre-requisite to a well-developed plan with SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and time-bound) objectives is that the healthcare manager must be able to perform proper scanning and focusing skills, which are actually \u201cleadership practices.\u201d Scanning refers to knowing one\u2019s self and environment together with the opportunities, threats, and risks to one\u2019s staff and the organization as a whole while focusing refers to concentrating each staff member's work in the healthcare organization relative to its vision and mission statements. Organizing is the ability to bring together the systems, processes, and procedures with the designated staff in an organization so that the right people will be able to do the proper work for the right purpose. Implementing skills, on the other hand, is focused on the performance of the assigned work based on planned activities. As a healthcare manager, one must know how to harmonize workflow within all concerned staff, ensuring that the individual and overall plans get implemented effectively. The leadership practices essential in organizing and implementing (management) skills include aligning and mobilizing the staff. While management skills are focused on the use of organizational resources as mentioned, the goal of leadership skills centers on the mobilization of the members of the organization. For instance, a healthcare manager organizing human resource with the actual operations will not be complete and will not properly work in its implementation phase if some of the staff lack the motivation, which could be caused by the loss of teamwork. Or, in other circumstance, some staff may have unclear roles and responsibilities, resulting in their confusion at work and eventually low performance and productivity. Aligning and mobilizing is making all staff, including healthcare managers, share a common vision and commitment for the healthcare organization. Lastly, monitoring and evaluating skills must be part of the practice of healthcare managers on whatever type of healthcare organization. Monitoring skills mean the ability to check the progress of the organization in terms of achieving its plans while evaluating skills means that a healthcare manager can assess the attainment of desired results (output) after the whole process is carried out. In simpler terms, monitoring occurs \u201cduring\u201d while evaluation is done \u201cafter\u201d the implementation of an organizational project or program. Furthermore, these combined skills of monitoring and evaluation (often termed as M&E) involve the provision of feedback that will further improve plans and implementation. However, feedback must not be limited to the management systems and processes. It should also include feedback from staff, as to whether their commitment is sustainable, and they are still motivated to perform the work; this is where the leadership practice of inspiring the team applies. A good healthcare manager can provide trust and confidence to staff and can appreciate staff efforts. The inspiration of staff can manifest by providing supportive supervision to all members of the organization.In practicing these healthcare management skills, it is evident that leadership skills are equally vital. Healthcare organizations should not develop professionals who can only manage or who are leaders alone \u2013 because such a man will be unsuccessful. The development and enhancement of management skills can come from a variety of learning strategies and actual experiences. [2] Healthcare management, as a specific profession, stresses its value and importance apart from the clinical aspects performed on the bedside.

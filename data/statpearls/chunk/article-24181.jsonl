For patients with mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, systemic treatment is often required. Meglumine or stibogluconate have been first-line therapy\u00a0and the WHO recommends antimonial pentavalent for a mucocutaneous disease. Treatment success rates have been as high 95% if high dosing strategies are utilized, although low dosing strategies are often used to minimize adverse effects. Azole therapies (i.e., fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole) have been used in isolation and in combination with amphotericin B. Their use is limited by regional variants of the disease and resistance as well as having a\u00a0minimal additive benefit to the already effective amphotericin. Agents established with good cure rates (= 90%) include amphotericin B (liposomal or colloidal dispersion), amphotericin B deoxicholate, and pentamidine.

VNG and ENG testing are tools used in assessing and diagnosing disorders related to the vestibular system and, as such, can play a significant role in clinical decision-making. These tests help evaluate the function of the inner ear and vestibular pathways, objectively documenting peripheral vestibular function and detecting central deficits not otherwise apparent during physical examination. The results obtained from VNG and ENG testing can guide the interprofessional healthcare team in developing effective treatment strategies tailored to the specific vestibular disorder diagnosis. For example, a patient with hearing loss who undergoes VNG or ENG testing demonstrating unilateral vestibular weakness may benefit from magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate for underlying acoustic neuroma. [2] [17] Contrarily, VNG or ENG testing results that suggest a central nervous system lesion may benefit from consultation with a neurologist."}

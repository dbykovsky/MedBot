Interpretation of drug tests is notoriously difficult because of the limited sensitivity and specificity of the assays and the variability among assays. Results of urine drug tests\u00a0should be discussed with each patient, and decision-making surrounding urine drug test values should include a multidisciplinary team and the patient. Because of the complex nature of result interpretation and test ordering, a close working relationship must be established with the laboratory. Clinicians should be encouraged to discuss these issues with a toxicologist or clinical chemist for a correct interpretation and to select further\u00a0tests."}

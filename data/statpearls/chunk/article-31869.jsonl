Research into the viability of prehospital ultrasound for various applications has grown even faster over the past several years; 20 studies and reviews have been published from 2015 to the present. Many of these were studied using the FAST. Still, at least\u00a05 studies examined lung ultrasound, and others looked at echocardiography during resuscitation, ultrasound to evaluate orotracheal tube placement, and even ultrasound-guided placement of Zone III Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta (REBOA). Although the breadth of topics and the number of prehospital ultrasound studies are promising, most were small. They did not include other characteristics of high-quality studies, such as blinding and randomization."}

Future applications for prehospital ultrasound are unlimited and could include ultrasound-guided venous access, fracture diagnosis, and nerve blocks for rural pain management. Prehospital ultrasound alters patients' diagnosis and emergency management services treatment, but evidence that it makes a difference in patient outcomes is lacking. More large, randomized, blinded prospective studies must be done. [28] [29] [30] [31] [32]", "contents": "EMS Ultrasound Use -- Clinical Significance.

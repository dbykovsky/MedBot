It provides a smooth surface that absorbs both oxygen from the environment and nutrients from tears to supply the other layers of the cornea. It also functions as a barrier to foreign substances. Bowman\u2019s layer (deep to the epithelium) is comprised of collagen to provide strength and structure. If injured, this layer can scar and impede vision (dark blue, Figure 1A). The stroma is the thickest layer of the cornea. Most of this layer is water with small amounts of collagen (gray, Figure 1A). Deep to the stroma, another strong layer of collagen, Descemet\u2019s membrane, provides a secondary layer against injuries and infections. This layer is created by the deeper endothelial cells and can regenerate if injured (orange, Figure 1A). The deepest layer is the endothelium (pink, Figure 1A). The endothelium serves as a pump to remove excess fluid out of the stroma. The fluid typically leaks from inside the eye into the stroma. Without the endothelial pump, the stroma swells. Because endothelium cells do not regenerate if damaged, damage can cause blindness. The only therapy for endothelial damage is a corneal transplant.

The pedicle of the paramedian forehead flap is meticulously elevated in a submuscular plane beneath the frontalis muscle, ensuring optimal vascular integrity. A delicate balance must be struck to achieve an ideal width centered on the supratrochlear vessels, typically 1.5 to 2 cm. A narrow pedicle risks incomplete vessel inclusion, while excessive width increases the likelihood of kinking during rotation, compromising perfusion. Surgeons estimate pedicle length using a surgical sponge, anchoring 1 end at the medial eyebrow and the other rotated down to the defect, which will give the surgeon an idea of how much length will be lost during the 180\u00b0 flap rotation (see Image . Forehead Flap Summary Diagrams). Flap orientation, contralateral to the larger defect portion (if the defect is not perfectly midline and symmetric), minimizes pedicle kinking and reduces vascular compromise risks, enhancing flap viability."}

However, most cases of IgA nephropathy are idiopathic. IgA is mainly produced at mucosal surfaces, and its main role is mucosal defense. After the mucosal injury, the IgA1 monomer undergoes a conformational change of its molecule and thus provides the substrate for antigen-antibody formation in susceptible individuals. Galactose-deficient IgA1 is synthesized as a consequence of the mucosal response to various antigens triggered by infections. Circulating immune complexes made from poorly galactosylated IgA1 bind to the mesangial cell plasma membrane, causing proliferation of the mesangial cells with the result of podocyte injury and loss of renal function.

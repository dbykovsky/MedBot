In almost all heart diseases, due to the high incidence and complexity, VPCs can be the major cause of mortality in coronary artery disease and dilated cardiomyopathy. According to the MRIFT and Framingham Heart Study, frequent occurrence of VPCs correlates with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death.

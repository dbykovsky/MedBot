Hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia can potentially lead to drug toxicity when taking quinidine. Hemolysis is a possible occurrence in patients with G6PD deficiencies when using quinidine. Cinchonism, which is associated with quinidine as it is a stereoisomer of quinine derived from the bark of the cinchona tree, can manifest with symptoms such as tinnitus, sensorineural hearing loss, blurring of vision, diplopia, photophobia, confusion, headache, delirium, and decreased hearing to profound deafness. Quinidine use may rarely lead to drug-induced lupus erythematosus (DILE). [16] Quinidine use has been associated with the development of Sjogren's syndrome. Blackwater fever, a condition linked to quinidine, is characterized by a triad of massive hemolysis, hemoglobinemia, and hemoglobinuria, potentially leading to acute kidney injury, jaundice, and, in severe cases, even death.

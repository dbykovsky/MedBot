In patients with LAA anatomies unsuitable for endocardial devices, Lariat is a great option, although the procedure's safety is still a concern. There are many studies with the use of a Lariat device. [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] Results of a retrospective safety registry with 154 patients showed a high technical success rate of 94%. [60] However, major complications occurred in about 10%, significant pericardial effusion rate-10%, major bleeding rate-9%, and emergency surgery requirement-2% of the patients.

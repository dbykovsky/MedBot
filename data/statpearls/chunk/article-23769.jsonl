The excessive accumulation of iron in vital organs, particularly the liver, heart, and endocrine glands, can lead to organ damage due to the formation of reactive oxygen species. Complications may manifest as liver diseases, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, cardiomyopathies affecting the heart, and endocrine disorders such as diabetes and hypothyroidism. Additionally, iron overload has been linked to increased susceptibility to infections and impaired immune response. Recognizing and managing these complications is crucial in preventing further deterioration of organ function and improving overall patient outcomes.

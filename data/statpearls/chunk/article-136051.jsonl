There is usually a decreased or normal FSH level in patients with OA. In contrast, FSH levels are typically high in NOA, especially if the testes are below normal size. However, some overlap exists, so FSH levels alone may not be sufficient for differentiation. (As a general rule, the higher the FSH, the more likely a significant spermatogenic failure will be.) Thus, a testicular biopsy may need to be\u00a0performed to make a definitive diagnosis. Fortunately, this is\u00a0necessary for diagnosis infrequently. [41]"}

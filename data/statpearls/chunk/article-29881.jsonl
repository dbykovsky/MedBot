[32] Nutritional zinc deficiency has been demonstrated to cause taste loss, with studies finding that zinc deficiency was associated with varying degrees of taste abnormalities and that zinc supplementation usually produced improvement in these abnormalities. [33] Taste distortion may also be a side effect of many drugs,\u00a0such as\u00a0the antifungals griseofulvin and terbinafine, and antihypertensive agents, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium channel blockers. [34] The antibiotic metronidazole is also associated with a metallic taste disturbance. Clinicians need to be aware of these side effects when prescribing medications, so they can convey accurate information to their patients and provide better care. Taste has a logical connection to overeating and obesity. [35] Obesity, being linked to diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other causes of morbidity and mortality, has quickly become a global health concern, with about 39% of the world's population considered to be overweight or clinically obese in 2018, a number that has undoubtedly grown significantly. [36] Studies have found that abnormalities in the central response to taste can develop in individuals who suffer from obesity and can be responsible for developing unhealthy eating patterns that can exacerbate obesity and difficulty in losing weight and maintaining weight loss in previously obese individuals. [37] Taste has been an often ignored sensory modality, considered not as crucial as other senses, and patients may often decline to disclose whether they have taste disorders spontaneously. The question \"Do you have a taste problem?\" was only able to identify 10% of patients with taste problems.\u00a0Clinicians must\u00a0directly approach this topic with patients and ask specific closed-ended questions to ensure appropriate history-taking. [38] Because of the plethora of potential etiologies of loss of taste, it can be challenging to diagnose a taste disorder. However,\u00a0further probing patients\u00a0regarding their symptoms, such as a change in taste, can lead to further implications such as loss of appetite, weight loss, malnutrition, and ultimately a poorer quality of life.\u00a0Ninety-five percent\u00a0of taste disorders have been shown to be caused by an impairment of smell rather than a loss of taste, so it is\u00a0of extreme importance to clinically evaluate for olfactory dysfunction."}

It is of three types, iatrogenic, primary, and secondary. Primary metatarsalgia occurs because of anatomical abnormalities of the metatarsals associated with pes cavus or hallux valgus. Secondary metatarsalgia is caused by indirect pressure or load on the anterior part of the foot. While iatrogenic one occurs as a consequence of foot surgery, e.g., osteotomy of the metatarsal may follow malunion or avascular necrosis, leading to metatarsalgia.

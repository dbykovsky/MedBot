The typical thinking was that a fire could spread very quickly; the earlier firefighters arrived, the more likely lives and property could be spared.

Very early \"ambulance drivers\" were just that. They had little to no formal medical training and, in most instances, did not even travel with the patient in the vehicle's rear.

Assigning this score, ranked ASA I through ASA VI, would thereby attempt to categorize the patient's risk of perioperative complications based on their physical status and overall health. Patients assigned to higher numerical categories have increased risk of perioperative adverse events. The goal of creating the ASA Physical Status Classification System (ASA-PS) was to improve patient outcomes and predict perioperative risk.

Assessment and evaluation of patients can vary between providers in different specialties compared to the staff anesthesiologists, causing a significant increase in standard deviation even when participants had access to the same medical records. This situation proves to be a problem that is more prevalent outside the specific specialty, posing a potential threat to the success of healthcare teams composed of multiple providers from multiple specialties. [2] Studies have shown that adding examples for each respective score aided both anesthesia and non-anesthesia providers consistently classifying patients accurately. [3] In 2014, the ASA provided access to a catalog of examples for simplification when assigning an ASA score, increasing accuracy and decreasing inter-observer variation.

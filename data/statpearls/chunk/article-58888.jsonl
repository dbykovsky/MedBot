Since some of the adverse effects are delayed-onset like colitis and hypophysitis, an outpatient oncology nurse should follow the patients. The clinician, nurse, and pharmacist team members should regularly check the renal and liver function. During IV administration, the drug is known to cause chills, fever, flushing, hypotension, hypoxemia, pruritis, rash, rigors, and wheezing. While checkpoint inhibitors have lower rates of infusion reaction than other monoclonal antibodies, it is still essential to monitor. More crucially, the drug may cause transient increases in blood glucose. Finally, because the drug can trigger an allergic reaction, the interprofessional team needs to have the necessary medications and equipment to counter it in the room.", "contents": "Pembrolizumab -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes.

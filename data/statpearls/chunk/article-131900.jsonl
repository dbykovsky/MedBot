Although there is some debate about the\u00a0risk factors\u00a0discussed above, the practitioner should educate the patient about\u00a0mitigating the risk of alveolar osteitis. Smoking cessation is something all patients should consider to deter several\u00a0complications, including AO. Females should also be aware that their risk can increase, especially if they are taking oral contraceptives. [4] Controlling factors such as these could reduce the incidence of AO. Detailed post-operative instructions are always\u00a0recommended, but this has been investigated, and there was no significant decrease in AO rate even when given."}

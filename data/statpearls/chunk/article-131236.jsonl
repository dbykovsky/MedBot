Addiction is now recognized as a chronic relapsing disorder triggered by repeat drug exposure in individuals vulnerable to genetics, development, and psychosocial conditions. These conditions encompass accessibility, drug use norms, and social support (or lack thereof). Drug use is fueled by the pharmacological effects of a substance, which result in rewarding experiences. The reinforcing effects of drug use heavily rely on dopamine signaling at the nucleus accumbens in the brain. Chronic exposure leads to glutamate-mediated adaptations in the striato-thalamo-cortical pathway, particularly in the prefrontal cortex at the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices. Another identified pathway is the limbic system, which comprises the amygdala and hippocampus. Drugs induce alterations in the extended amygdala, resulting in negative baseline emotional states that the drug temporarily alleviates. Counterintuitively, drug use is associated with blunted dopamine release in brain reward regions.

[41]", "contents": "Veteran and Military Mental Health Issues -- Etiology -- Substance Use Disorders. Neuroscientific advances have significantly enhanced our understanding of drug effects on the brain. Addiction is now recognized as a chronic relapsing disorder triggered by repeat drug exposure in individuals vulnerable to genetics, development, and psychosocial conditions. These conditions encompass accessibility, drug use norms, and social support (or lack thereof). Drug use is fueled by the pharmacological effects of a substance, which result in rewarding experiences. The reinforcing effects of drug use heavily rely on dopamine signaling at the nucleus accumbens in the brain. Chronic exposure leads to glutamate-mediated adaptations in the striato-thalamo-cortical pathway, particularly in the prefrontal cortex at the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices. Another identified pathway is the limbic system, which comprises the amygdala and hippocampus.

Patients who have experienced non-completed suicide attempts have a significantly increased risk for subsequent attempts. Although the risk of completed suicide is highest in the first year after an attempt, the danger can remain elevated for a decade. [89] [90] Several studies estimate that the risk of a repeat suicide attempt is approximately 5% to 10% over a timeframe ranging from 5 to 35\u00a0years. [91] Providers should screen for depression and SUDs, as they are correlated with completed suicides through an increased likelihood of further attempts. [92] [93]"}

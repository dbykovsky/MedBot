Development of subsequent infections is a concern with an approximate 10% risk; abdominal washout should be a consideration, and skin/subcutaneous tissues may be left open to heal by secondary intention when urgent/emergent reoperation is necessary, and the surgeon encounters frankly contaminated, or necrotic tissue. [17] Complications include death, evisceration, and associated infections in the acute setting; bowel herniation can occur, and an incisional hernia can form with the development of subsequent bowel obstruction and/or strangulation in both the short- and long-term setting. The need for additional procedures to repair the defect or hernia, reduce or resect involved bowel, and drain accumulated fluid collections potentiate the risks of anesthesia-, surgical- and hospital-associated complications including pneumonia, hospital-acquired infection, prolonged ICU courses, deconditioning, adhesive small bowel obstruction, venous thromboembolic events, and need for short- or long-term rehab/nursing care. Notably, fascial dehiscence can vastly impact a patient\u2019s duration, and quality of life and consequently modifiable risk factors (both patient and technical) should be managed to improve patient outcomes.

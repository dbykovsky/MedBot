Owing to the delayed effect of heme therapy on reducing plasma ALA and PBG levels, intravenous heme therapy (IHT) should be\u00a0administered without delay in severe acute attacks and maintained for four days (3 to 4 mg/kg of heme/day). A response usually appears on the third day with a decrease of urine and serum PBG. Panhematin administration should be through a large peripheral vein or central line due to the risk of phlebitis in small veins, a risk also reduced by preparing it with human albumin instead of water.

Optic neuritis, inflammation of the optic nerve, characteristically presents as unilateral vision loss with pain on eye movement. Patients are typically females between 30 to 50 years of age. Demyelination of the retinal ganglion cell axons leads to optic nerve atrophy. PERG studies in MS have shown preferential N95 amplitude reduction with P50 sparing. Notably, reports have shown reductions in both N95 and P50 in acute optic neuritis, with the recovery of P50 to normal after remission. [11] [12]"}

NAION patients typically exhibit N95 amplitude reduction with the preservation of P50 in the PERG response.

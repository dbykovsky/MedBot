[4] If the pregnant person is Rh(D)-negative, they may develop antibodies against the Rh(D) antigen if they are exposed to Rh(D)-positive fetal blood. This is known as alloimmunization and can lead to future hemolytic disease of the newborn. [24] Knowledge of a patient's Rh status becomes more important as the pregnancy progresses due to the risk of\u00a0Rh(D)-alloimmunization increasing as the number of fetal erythrocytes increases. [2] Approximately 11% of patients with a threatened miscarriage may experience maternal exposure to fetal blood and thus be at risk for alloimmunization. [25] Patients at risk of alloimmunization (eg, an Rh-negative pregnant person with bleeding) can be given Rh(D)-immune globulin to prevent the development of these antibodies; however, international guidelines vary regarding its use in the first trimester.

Surgical options include endomyocardial resection and valve replacement or repair. Patients with Loeffler\u00a0endocarditis may need mitral valve replacement due to mitral regurgitation. Data on outcomes are limited. Tricuspid valve surgery is associated with increased postsurgical mortality (15%-30%). The mitral valve can be replaced with either a mechanical or bioprosthetic valve, but a biological valve is preferable due to a high incidence of mechanical valve thrombosis."}

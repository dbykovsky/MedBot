(1962) developed a full 27-point scoring system for bone age assessment, including the assessment of four growth centers (lateral condyle and epicondyle, trochlea, olecranon apophysis, and proximal radial epiphysis) on AP and lateral radiographs of the left elbow. This assessment modality involves relatively greater radiation exposure. The order of appearance and fusion of different ossification centers\u00a0around\u00a0the elbow and their correlation with chronological age has been described [16] : capitellum (0-1 year; 10-15 years), radial head (2-6 years; 12-16 years), medial epicondyle (2-8 years; 13 years), trochlea (5-11 years; 10-18 years), olecranon (6-11 years; 13-16 years) and lateral epicondyle (8-13 years; 12-16 years).

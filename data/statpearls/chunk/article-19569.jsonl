Nevertheless, it can miss the diagnosis at times due to sampling errors. [26] The diagnosis of cirrhosis by biopsy requires the presence of fibrosis and nodules. The nodular pattern can be micronodular, macronodular, or mixed with the micronodular pattern representing an independent risk factor\u00a0for elevated hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) and more severe disease. [26] Noninvasive tests using direct and indirect serum markers are used to detect patients with significant fibrosis/cirrhosis from patients with no/mild fibrosis. [27] [28] [29]"}

Nerve blocks can be applied proximal to the injury for broader anesthesia or regionally for targeted anesthesia near the affected tissue. The digital nerve block is a technique offering focused anesthesia that is generally better tolerated than local wound infiltration and requires a comparatively modest amount of anesthetic for a substantial anesthesia area. [17] This technique finds application in various procedures, including complex laceration repair, phalangeal dislocation or fracture reduction, drainage of digital infections like felon or paronychia, nail plate removal, or ring entrapment and removal. Proficiency with the anatomy and technique of the digital nerve block empowers clinicians to integrate it extensively into their practice.", "contents": "Digital Nerve Block -- Clinical Significance.

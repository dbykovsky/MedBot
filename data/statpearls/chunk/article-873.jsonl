Semicircular canals, however, are responsible for detecting head rotation since these are sensitive to angular acceleration. These organize in a push-pull structure consisting of one coplanar canal on the left side and another coplanar canal on the right side, which work by coordinating with each other. Humans have a total of six canals arranged in three main planes (anterior, posterior, horizontal) on both sides; each plane has a pair of canals. A canal will get stimulated by head motion towards that canal. [2] When a canal on one side is activated, there is inhibition of the other one during angular head movements. When there are head movements and rotation, the velocity of the movements dictates the difference in firing rate between the two semicircular canals. Hair cells are embedded in a fluid and gelatinous structure called the ampulla in each canal. When our heads rotate, the canal will move relative to the fluid inside of it, which will create a force against the ampulla, causing hair cells to bend. When the head is at rest, vestibular afferents have tonic discharge; this results in a balance between the semicircular canal pairs. Cases of nystagmus and ocular misalignment may be interpreted by understanding the organization and structure of the semicircular canals and otolith organs within the head.

Researchers found 12.8% of patients in a large electronic medical records database have a penicillin allergy listed in one large cohort. [57] [Level 3] Patients with a reported penicillin allergy are as much as four times more likely to be prescribed a macrolide antimicrobial. [56] [Level 1] However, a detailed history of a patient\u2019s adverse reaction(s) to penicillin, paying close attention to features suggestive of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity (e.g., urticaria, anaphylaxis), is often sufficient to clarify, and possibly remove, a listing of penicillin allergy. [58] [Level 5] Patients with more concerning histories may be administered allergy testing or referred to an allergy specialist. Lastly, providers should be aware of the low cross-reactivity rates with cephalosporins\u2014especially third- and higher-generation agents\u2014and other beta-lactams in penicillin allergy.

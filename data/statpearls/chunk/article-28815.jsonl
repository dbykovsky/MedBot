Second impact syndrome has recently gained increased attention as many cite athletes sustaining a concussion and returning to the sport early as being particularly at risk.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 1.6 to 3.8 million sports-related concussions occur in the United States each year. [2] While the etiology of a concussion is generally understood, the etiology of a second impact syndrome is not well understood. The generally accepted cause relates to sustaining a second concussion before the brain has a chance to recover from the initial insult fully. The athlete will rapidly develop altered mental status and a loss of consciousness within seconds to minutes of the second hit, resulting in catastrophic neurological injury. [3] The devastating injury results from the\u00a0dysfunctional cerebral blood flow autoregulation, leading to an increase in intracranial pressure. The pressure rapidly develops and eventually results in brain herniation. The herniation may occur either medially across the falx cerebri or inferiorly through the foramen magnum, resulting in brain stem injury and rapid deterioration and leading to death within 2 to 5 minutes. A recent case report sheds some light on the injury pattern [4] . An athlete returned to hitting drills five days after his initial concussion. He had a routine CT scan on day four but had a persistent severe headache. After getting hit at practice one day later, he collapsed several plays later after complaining of headaches and not being able to feel his legs. A second CT done in a local emergency room demonstrated bilateral but thin subdural hematomas. However, a subsequent MRI demonstrated caudal displacement of midline structures with injury to both thalami resulting in transtentorial herniation.

Patients may also benefit from calcium and vitamin D supplementation, though studies do not demonstrate a clear benefit or quicker healing. In one study of female U.S. Navy recruits, given 2000 milligrams of calcium along with 800 international units of vitamin D had a 20% reduction in stress fractures during training. [17] Some difficulties are generalizing the findings to the population at large or females attending boot camps of the other military branches.\u00a0 However, another study by Tenforde et al. found female athletes using a calcium supplement had a three times higher risk of stress fractures.

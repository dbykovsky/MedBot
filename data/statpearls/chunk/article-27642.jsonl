Specifically, abdominal X-rays submit 200 mrad (0.1 to 0.3 rads) of ionizing radiation to the fetus, while abdominal and pelvic computer tomography (CT) scan subjects the fetus to 3\u00a0to 4 rads. The accepted accumulated dose of ionizing radiation during pregnancy is less than 10 rads, with no single diagnostic study exceeding 5 rads. Between 8 to 15 weeks gestation, high-dose radiation (>10 rads) may lead to intra-uterine growth retardation and central nervous defects. Beyond 15 weeks, there appear to be no dose-dependent effects such as fetal loss or congenital defects. Stochastic effects, such as the subsequent risk of cancer or leukemia, are increased with exposure of 1 rad or more. The rate of such effect is approximately 1 for every 500 high-dose exposures. Efforts should be taken to decrease unnecessary scans, reduce the overlap of body sections, and avoid multiple passes when possible."}

Up to 270 degrees of ciliary body can be treated with one corneal incision. However, 360-degree treatment requires an extra nasal or superior corneal incision. Viscoelastic is then removed from the anterior chamber via irrigation and aspiration, and the corneal wounds are sealed. Intracameral or subconjunctival antibiotics and corticosteroids are routinely given at the end of the procedure, followed by topical postoperative steroids and antibiotics. [7] [8]"}

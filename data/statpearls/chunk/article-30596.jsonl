However, there appeared to be insufficient data to address why there was such a disparity. There is a growing body of literature that underscores an important relationship between socioeconomic status, racial factors, and clinical outcomes. Black and Hispanic patients appear to be at risk of increased mortality and increased morbidity. [5] Addressing health care disparities and modifiable socioeconomic factors can improve clinical outcomes, especially for at-risk populations. [5] [Level 3]"}
